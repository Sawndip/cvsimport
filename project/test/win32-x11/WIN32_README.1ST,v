The preesent source tree is in beta stage.


Warning the present code in BETA stage. Not suited for end-users.
==========================================

The source tree is patched for MingW32/GCC-2.9.5.2, but Imake needs fixes therefore using MingW32
"make World.Ming" will not work. To experiment compilation with MingW32, please rename the file
/xc/Makefile/ming to /xc/Makfile

The code compiles with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0, SDK April 2000 Release.  
To compile with MSVC, please copy and rename the copy /xc/Makefile.msv to /xc/Makefile.

The xc/config/fc directory contains two subdirectories "intel" and "msvc".  If you are compiling
with MSVC 6.0, copy Win32.cf from xc/config/cf/msvc to /xc/config/cf.

If compiling with Intel Visual C++ compiler 4.5, copy the Win32.cf file from /xc/config/cf/intel
to /xc/config/cf.

After you have set vcvars32, and setenv from SDK and VC98 directories (In case of Intel you need
to set iccvars, using iccvars.bat)

make World.Win32 (The command is case sensitive, contorary to belief that Win32 is not case sensitive)
should compile the X clients, X libs and XWin X-server.

The code in imake-migw is patched for MingW32, but it gave probelms with MSVC compilers
so I put in a different directory.  If compiling with MIngW32/GCC, rename imake to imake-msvc and imake-mingw
to imake directory.

Do not forget to edit StdInclude path for your MSVC and SDK installation.

You will need in addition DirectX 6.1 or higher.  I used DIrectX 7.1 from MSDN Universal
Subscription.


KNOWN PROBLEMS:
=================

1) X-server has display problems.  If the security policies are not set properly
you get the following errors:

G:\usr\bin\X11>Xwin :0
Successful addition of Screen 36367961 009C4850

ort 2052
CopySurface(887601ae)
A: Surface Lock failed


2) Often server will crash with DirectX Surface Lock failed message.

3) icl.exe from Intel Compiler C/C++ 4.5 produce makedepend.exe which crashes with memory
read/write violations.  The only workaround at the moment is use cl.exe from Microsoft Compilers.
Although, it does not do full optimization for Pentium II and III CPU, but something is better
then nothing, till I fix the bug in makedepend.

4) Code was compiled with MSVC 6.0 and SDK April 2000 Release.  I did not use previous version of
MSVC, but I assume they could work too.

5) XWin.exe (DirectX based X-server) tested only on Windows 2000, Windows 98 and Windows Millenium Beta 3.

6) Screen background turns shiny green when server runs in 32 Bit colors mode.
