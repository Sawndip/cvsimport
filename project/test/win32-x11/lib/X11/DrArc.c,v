/* Note to future maintainers:  XDrawArc does NOT batch successive PolyArc
   requests into a single request like XDrawLine, XDrawPoint, etc.
   We don't do this because X_PolyArc applies the GC's join-style if
   the last point in one arc coincides with the first point in another.
   The client wouldn't expect this and would have no easy way to defeat it. */
