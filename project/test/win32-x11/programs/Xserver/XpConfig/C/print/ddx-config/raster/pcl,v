# This is the file which you should customize to include the printers that
# will print through the raster driver.  The early part of this file 
# specifies some commn useful defaults.  You can override them when
# you list your printers in the second part of this file.  This file is
# an X Resource file.  To learn more about this file format, consult
# the functional specification.

# Note that the reference printer for CDEnext is the HP DeskJet 1600C.
# This driver may work for other printers, but the reference printer
# is the only officially supported printer.


# DEFAULTS

# The attributes below apply to all printers unless the section below 
# specifies something different for the printer.  

# Default printer attributes
