The X server uses this directory to store the compiled version of the
current keymap and/or any scratch keymaps used by clients.  The X server
or some other tool might destroy or replace the files in this directory,
so it is not a safe place to store compiled keymaps for long periods of
time.  The default keymap for any server is usually stored in:
     X<num>-default.xkm
where <num> is the display number of the server in question, which makes
it possible for several servers *on the same host* to share the same 
directory.

Unless the X server is modified, sharing this directory between servers on
different hosts could cause problems.
