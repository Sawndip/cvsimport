.SH NAME
.B "fglCullFace
\- specify whether front- or back-facing facets can be culled

.SH FORTRAN SPECIFICATION
SUBROUTINE \f3fglCullFace\fP(
INTEGER*4 \fImode\fP )
.nf
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2mode\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2mode\fP
Specifies whether front- or back-facing facets are candidates for culling.
Symbolic constants
\f3GL_FRONT\fP, \f3GL_BACK\fP, and \f3GL_FRONT_AND_BACK\fP are accepted.
The initial value is \f3GL_BACK\fP.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3fglCullFace\fP specifies whether front- or back-facing facets are culled
(as specified by \f2mode\fP) when facet culling is enabled. Facet
culling is initially disabled.
To enable and disable facet culling, call the
\f3fglEnable\fP and \f3fglDisable\fP commands
with the argument \f3GL_CULL_FACE\fP.
Facets include triangles,
quadrilaterals,
polygons,
and rectangles.
.P
\f3fglFrontFace\fP specifies which of the clockwise and counterclockwise facets
are front-facing and back-facing.
See \f3fglFrontFace\fP.
.SH NOTES
If  \f2mode\fP is \f3GL_FRONT_AND_BACK\fP, no facets are drawn, but other
primitives such as points and lines are drawn.
.SH ERRORS
\f3GL_INVALID_ENUM\fP is generated if \f2mode\fP is not an accepted value.
.P
\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \f3fglCullFace\fP
is executed between the execution of \f3fglBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \f3fglEnd\fP.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
\f3fglIsEnabled\fP with argument \f3GL_CULL_FACE\fP
.br
\f3fglGet\fP with argument \f3GL_CULL_FACE_MODE\fP
