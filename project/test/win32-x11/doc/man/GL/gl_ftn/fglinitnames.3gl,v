.SH FORTRAN SPECIFICATION
SUBROUTINE \f3fglInitNames\fP( )
.nf
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
The name stack is used during selection mode to allow sets of rendering
commands to be uniquely identified.
It consists of an ordered set of unsigned integers.
\f3fglInitNames\fP causes the name stack to be initialized to its default empty state.
.P
The name stack is always empty while the render mode is not \f3GL_SELECT\fP.
Calls to \f3fglInitNames\fP while the render mode is not \f3GL_SELECT\fP are ignored.
.SH ERRORS
\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \f3fglInitNames\fP
is executed between the execution of \f3fglBegin\fP and the corresponding execution of
\f3fglEnd\fP.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
\f3fglGet\fP with argument \f3GL_NAME_STACK_DEPTH\fP
.br
\f3fglGet\fP with argument \f3GL_MAX_NAME_STACK_DEPTH\fP
