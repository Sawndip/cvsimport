.SH NAME
.B "fglCallList
\- execute a display list

.SH FORTRAN SPECIFICATION
SUBROUTINE \f3fglCallList\fP(
INTEGER*4 \fIlist\fP )
.nf
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2list\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2list\fP
Specifies the integer name of the display list to be executed.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3fglCallList\fP causes the named display list to be executed.
The commands saved in the display list are executed in order,
just as if they were called without using a display list.
If \f2list\fP has not been defined as a display list,
\f3fglCallList\fP is ignored.
.P
\f3fglCallList\fP can appear inside a display list.
To avoid the possibility of infinite recursion resulting from display lists
calling one another,
a limit is placed on the nesting level of display
lists during display-list execution.
This limit is at least 64, and it depends on the implementation.
.P
GL state is not saved and restored across a call to \f3fglCallList\fP.
Thus,
changes made to GL state during the execution of a display list
remain after execution of the display list is completed.
Use \f3fglPushAttrib\fP,
\f3fglPopAttrib\fP,
\f3fglPushMatrix\fP,
and \f3fglPopMatrix\fP to preserve GL state across \f3fglCallList\fP calls.
.SH NOTES
Display lists can be executed between a call to \f3fglBegin\fP
and the corresponding call to \f3fglEnd\fP,
as long as the display list includes only commands that are allowed
in this interval.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
\f3fglGet\fP with argument \f3GL_MAX_LIST_NESTING\fP
.br
\f3fglIsList\fP
.SH SEE ALSO
\f3fglCallLists\fP,
\f3fglDeleteLists\fP,
\f3fglGenLists\fP,
\f3fglNewList\fP,
