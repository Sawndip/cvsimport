.SH NAME
.B "glGenTextures
\- generate texture names

.SH C SPECIFICATION
void \f3glGenTextures\fP(
GLsizei \fIn\fP,
.nf
.ta \w'\f3void \fPglGenTextures( 'u
	GLuint \fI*textures\fP )
.fi

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\fItextures\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2n\fP
Specifies the number of texture names to be generated.
.TP
\f2textures\fP
Specifies an array in which the generated texture names are stored.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glGenTextures\fP returns \f2n\fP texture names in \f2textures\fP.
There is no guarantee that the names form a contiguous set of integers;
however, it is guaranteed that none of the returned names was in use
immediately before the call to \%\f3glGenTextures\fP.
.P
The generated textures have no dimensionality; they assume the dimensionality
of the texture target to which they are first bound
(see \%\f3glBindTexture\fP).
.P
Texture names returned by a call to \%\f3glGenTextures\fP are not returned by
subsequent calls, unless they are first deleted with
\%\f3glDeleteTextures\fP.
.SH NOTES
\%\f3glGenTextures\fP is available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_VALUE\fP is generated if \f2n\fP is negative.
.P
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glGenTextures\fP is executed
between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP and the corresponding
execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.SH ASSOCIATED GETS
\%\f3glIsTexture\fP
