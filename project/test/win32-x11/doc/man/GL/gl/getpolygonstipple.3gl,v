.SH NAME
.B "glGetPolygonStipple
\- return the polygon stipple pattern

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP \w'\f2mask\fP\ \ 'u 
\f2mask\fP
Returns the stipple pattern. The initial value is all 1's. 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\%\f3glGetPolygonStipple\fP returns to \f2mask\fP a $32 ~times~ 32$ polygon stipple pattern.
The pattern is packed into memory as if \%\f3glReadPixels\fP
with both \f2height\fP and \f2width\fP of 32,
\f2type\fP of \%\f3GL_BITMAP\fP,
and \f2format\fP of \%\f3GL_COLOR_INDEX\fP were called,
and the stipple pattern were stored in an internal $32 ~times~ 32$ color
index buffer.
Unlike \%\f3glReadPixels\fP,
however,
pixel transfer operations
(shift, offset, pixel map)
are not applied to the returned stipple image.
.SH NOTES
If an error is generated,
no change is made to the contents of \f2mask\fP.
.SH ERRORS
\%\f3GL_INVALID_OPERATION\fP is generated if \%\f3glGetPolygonStipple\fP
is executed between the execution of \%\f3glBegin\fP
and the corresponding execution of \%\f3glEnd\fP.
.SH SEE ALSO
\%\f3glPixelStore\fP,
\%\f3glPixelTransfer\fP,
\%\f3glPolygonStipple\fP,
