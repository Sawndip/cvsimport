       <B>glXChooseVisual</B>  -  return a visual that matches specified
       attributes



</PRE>
<H2>C SPECIFICATION</H2><PRE>
       XVisualInfo* <B>glXChooseVisual</B>( Display <I>*dpy</I>,
                                     int <I>screen</I>,
                                     int <I>*attribList</I> )



</PRE>
<H2>PARAMETERS</H2><PRE>
       <I>dpy</I>         Specifies the connection to the X server.

       <I>screen</I>      Specifies the screen number.

       <I>attribList</I>  Specifies a list  of  boolean  attributes  and
                   integer   attribute/value   pairs.   The  last
                   attribute must be <B>None</B>.


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>glXChooseVisual</B> returns a pointer to an XVisualInfo struc­
       ture describing the visual that best meets a minimum spec­
       ification.  The boolean GLX attributes of the visual  that
       is returned will match the specified values, and the inte­
       ger GLX attributes will meet or exceed the specified mini­
       mum  values.  If all other attributes are equivalent, then
       TrueColor  and  PseudoColor  visuals  have  priority  over
       DirectColor  and StaticColor visuals, respectively.  If no
       conforming visual exists, <B>NULL</B> is returned.  To  free  the
       data returned by this function, use <B>XFree</B>.

       All   boolean  GLX  attributes  default  to  <B>False</B>  except
       <B>GLX_USE_GL</B>, which  defaults  to  <B>True</B>.   All  integer  GLX
       attributes  default  to  zero.  Default specifications are
       superseded by attributes included in <I>attribList</I>.   Boolean
       attributes  included  in  <I>attribList</I>  are understood to be
       <B>True</B>.  Integer attributes and enumerated  type  attributes
       are  followed  immediately by the corresponding desired or
       minimum value.  The list must be terminated with <B>None</B>.

       The interpretations of the various GLX  visual  attributes
       are as follows:

       <B>GLX_USE_GL</B>            Ignored.   Only  visuals that can be
                             rendered with GLX are considered.

       <B>GLX_BUFFER_SIZE</B>       Must be followed  by  a  nonnegative
                             integer  that  indicates the desired
                             color index buffer size.  The small­
                             est  index  buffer  of  at least the
                             specified   size    is    preferred.
                             Ignored if <B>GLX_RGBA</B> is asserted.
                             buffer-level  specification.    This
                             specification  is  honored  exactly.
                             Buffer level zero corresponds to the
                             main  frame  buffer  of the display.
                             Buffer level one is the first  over­
                             lay frame buffer, level two the sec­
                             ond overlay frame buffer, and so on.
                             Negative buffer levels correspond to
                             underlay frame buffers.

       <B>GLX_RGBA</B>              If  present,  only   TrueColor   and
                             DirectColor  visuals are considered.
                             Otherwise,  only   PseudoColor   and
                             StaticColor  visuals are considered.

       <B>GLX_DOUBLEBUFFER</B>      If  present,  only   double-buffered
                             visuals are considered.   Otherwise,
                             only  single-buffered  visuals   are
                             considered.

       <B>GLX_STEREO</B>            If  present, only stereo visuals are
                             considered.  Otherwise,  only  mono­
                             scopic visuals are considered.

       <B>GLX_AUX_BUFFERS</B>       Must  be  followed  by a nonnegative
                             integer that indicates  the  desired
                             number  of auxiliary buffers.  Visu­
                             als with the    smallest  number  of
                             auxiliary   buffers  that  meets  or
                             exceeds  the  specified  number  are
                             preferred.

       <B>GLX_RED_SIZE</B>          Must  be  followed  by a nonnegative
                             minimum size specification.  If this
                             value  is  zero, the smallest avail­
                             able red buffer is preferred.   Oth­
                             erwise,  the  largest  available red
                             buffer of at least the minimum  size
                             is preferred.

       <B>GLX_GREEN_SIZE</B>        Must  be  followed  by a nonnegative
                             minimum size specification.  If this
                             value  is  zero, the smallest avail­
                             able  green  buffer  is   preferred.
                             Otherwise,   the  largest  available
                             green buffer of at least the minimum
                             size is preferred.

       <B>GLX_BLUE_SIZE</B>         Must  be  followed  by a nonnegative
                             minimum size specification.  If this
                             value  is  zero, the smallest avail­
                             able blue buffer is preferred.  Oth­
                             is preferred.

       <B>GLX_ALPHA_SIZE</B>        Must  be  followed  by a nonnegative
                             minimum size specification.  If this
                             value  is  zero, the smallest avail­
                             able  alpha  buffer  is   preferred.
                             Otherwise,   the  largest  available
                             alpha buffer of at least the minimum
                             size is preferred.

       <B>GLX_DEPTH_SIZE</B>        Must  be  followed  by a nonnegative
                             minimum size specification.  If this
                             value is zero, visuals with no depth
                             buffer  are  preferred.   Otherwise,
                             the  largest  available depth buffer
                             of at least the minimum size is pre­
                             ferred.

       <B>GLX_STENCIL_SIZE</B>      Must  be  followed  by a nonnegative
                             integer that indicates  the  desired
                             number  of  stencil  bitplanes.  The
                             smallest stencil buffer of at  least
                             the specified size is preferred.  If
                             the desired value is  zero,  visuals
                             with  no  stencil  buffer  are  pre­
                             ferred.

       <B>GLX_ACCUM_RED_SIZE</B>    Must be followed  by  a  nonnegative
                             minimum size specification.  If this
                             value is zero, visuals with  no  red
                             accumulation  buffer  are preferred.
                             Otherwise, the largest possible  red
                             accumulation  buffer of at least the
                             minimum size is preferred.

       <B>GLX_ACCUM_GREEN_SIZE</B>  Must be followed  by  a  nonnegative
                             minimum size specification.  If this
                             value is zero, visuals with no green
                             accumulation  buffer  are preferred.
                             Otherwise,  the   largest   possible
                             green   accumulation  buffer  of  at
                             least the minimum size is preferred.

       <B>GLX_ACCUM_BLUE_SIZE</B>   Must  be  followed  by a nonnegative
                             minimum size specification.  If this
                             value  is zero, visuals with no blue
                             accumulation buffer  are  preferred.
                             Otherwise, the largest possible blue
                             accumulation buffer of at least  the
                             minimum size is preferred.

       <B>GLX_ACCUM_ALPHA_SIZE</B>  Must  be  followed  by a nonnegative
                             accumulation buffer  are  preferred.
                             Otherwise,   the   largest  possible
                             alpha  accumulation  buffer  of   at
                             least the minimum size is preferred.

       Specifies a single-buffered RGB visual in the normal frame
       buffer, not an overlay or underlay buffer.   The  returned
       visual supports at least four bits each of red, green, and
       blue, and possibly no bits of alpha.  It does not  support
       color index mode, double-buffering, or stereo display.  It
       may or may not have one or more auxiliary color buffers, a
       depth buffer, a stencil buffer, or an accumulation buffer.


</PRE>
<H2>NOTES</H2><PRE>
       <B>XVisualInfo</B> is defined in <I>Xutil.h.</I>  It is a structure that
       includes <I>visual</I>, <I>visualID</I>, <I>screen</I>, and <I>depth</I> elements.

       <B>glXChooseVisual</B>  is  implemented  as a client-side utility
       using only  <B>XGetVisualInfo</B>  and  <B>glXGetConfig</B>.   Calls  to
       these  two  routines  can  be  used to implement selection
       algorithms other  than  the  generic  one  implemented  by
       <B>glXChooseVisual</B>.

       GLX  implementers  are  strongly discouraged, but not pro­
       scribed, from changing the  selection  algorithm  used  by
       <B>glXChooseVisual</B>.   Therefore,  selections  may change from
       release to release of the client-side library.

       There is no direct filter for picking  only  visuals  that
       support  GLXPixmaps.  GLXPixmaps are supported for visuals
       whose <B>GLX_BUFFER_SIZE</B> is one of  the  pixmap  depths  sup­
       ported by the X server.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       <B>NULL</B>  is returned if an undefined GLX attribute is encoun­
       tered in <I>attribList</I>.
