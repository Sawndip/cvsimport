matrix that produces a perspective projection.  The  current  ma­
trix (see _cmnd(MatrixMode)) is multiplied by this matrix and the
result replaces the current matrix, as if _cmnd(MultMatrix)  were
called with the following matrix as its argument:





                            down 150
{left [ ~~~ { down 165 matrix {
   ccol  {  {{2  ~  _eqnparam5} over {_eqnparam2 ~-~ _eqnparam1}}
above 0 above 0 above 0 }
   ccol { 0 above {{2 ~ _eqnparam5} over  {_eqnparam4  ~-~  _eqn­
param3}} ~ above 0 above 0 }
   ccol { A ~~~~ above B ~~~~ above C ~~~~ above -1 ~~~~}
   ccol { 0 above 0 above D above 0} }} ~~~ right ]}

                            down 130
{A  ~=~  {_eqnparam2  ~+~  _eqnparam1} over {_eqnparam2 ~-~ _eqn­
param1}}

                            down 130
{B ~=~ {_eqnparam4 ~+~ _eqnparam3}  over  {_eqnparam4  ~-~  _eqn­
param3}}

                            down 130
{C  ~=~  -{{_eqnparam6 ~+~ _eqnparam5} over {_eqnparam6 ~-~ _eqn­
param5}}}

                            down 130
{D ~=~ -^{{2 ~ _eqnparam6  ~  _eqnparam5}  over  {_eqnparam6  ~-~
_eqnparam5}}}

<H2>Typically,  the  matrix  mode  is  GL_PROJECTION,  and  (_param1,</H2><PRE>
_param3, -_param5) and (_param2, _param4,  -_param5) specify  the
points  on  the  near clipping plane that are mapped to the lower
left and upper right corners of the window, assuming that the eye
is  located at (0, 0, 0).  -_param6 specifies the location of the
far clipping plane.  Both _param5 and _param6 must  be  positive.
Use  _cmnd(PushMatrix)  and  _cmnd(PopMatrix) to save and restore
the current matrix stack.  Depth buffer precision is affected  by
the  values  specified  for _param5 and _param6.  The greater the
ratio of _param6 to _param5 is,  the  less  effective  the  depth
buffer  will  be at distinguishing between surfaces that are near
each other.  If

               $r ~=~ _eqnparam6 over _eqnparam5$

roughly $log sub 2 (r)$ bits of depth buffer precision are  lost.
Because  $r$ approaches infinity as _param5 approaches 0, _param5
