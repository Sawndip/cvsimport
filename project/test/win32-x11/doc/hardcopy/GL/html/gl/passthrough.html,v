rasterized is fed back to the application using the GL.  See  the
_cmnd(FeedbackBuffer)  reference  page  for  a description of the
feedback buffer and the values in it.  _cmnd inserts  a  user-de­
fined  marker in the feedback buffer when it is executed in feed­
back mode.  _param1 is returned as if it were a primitive; it  is
indicated    with    its    own    unique    identifying   value:

</PRE>
<H2>GL_PASS_THROUGH_TOKEN.  The order of _cmnd commands with  respect</H2><PRE>
to the specification of graphics primitives is maintained.  _cmnd
is   ignored   if   the   GL   is   not   in    feedback    mode.

</PRE>
<H2>GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if _cmnd is executed between</H2><PRE>
the execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding execution  of

</PRE>
<H2>_cmnd(End).   _cmnd(Get) with argument GL_RENDER_MODE _cmnd(Feed­</H2><PRE>
