3D position in window coordinates.   This  position,  called  the
raster position, is used to position pixel and bitmap write oper­
ations. It  is  maintained  with  subpixel  accuracy.   See  _cm­
nd(Bitmap),  _cmnd(DrawPixels),  and _cmnd(CopyPixels).  The cur­
rent raster position consists of three window  coordinates  ($x$,
$y$,  $z$), a clip coordinate value ($w$), an eye coordinate dis­
tance, a valid bit, and associated color data and texture coordi­
nates.   The  $w$ coordinate is a clip coordinate, because $w$ is
not projected to window coordinates.  _cmnd(RasterPos4) specifies
object  coordinates  $x$,  $y$,  $z$,  and  $w$ explicitly.  _cm­
nd(RasterPos3) specifies object coordinate $x$, $y$, and $z$  ex­
plicitly,  while  $w$  is implicitly set to 1.  _cmnd(RasterPos2)
uses the argument values for $x$ and $y$ while implicitly setting
$z$ and $w$ to 0 and 1.  The object coordinates presented by _cm­
nd are treated just like those of a _cmnd(Vertex)  command:  They
are  transformed by the current modelview and projection matrices
and passed to the clipping stage.  If the vertex is  not  culled,
then  it is projected and scaled to window coordinates, which be­
come   the    new    current    raster    position,    and    the

</PRE>
<H2>GL_CURRENT_RASTER_POSITION_VALID  flag  is  set.   If  the vertex</H2><PRE>
culled, then the valid bit is cleared and the current raster  po­
sition  and  associated  color  and texture coordinates are unde­
fined.  The current raster position also includes some associated
color data and texture coordinates.  If lighting is enabled, then

</PRE>
<H2>GL_CURRENT_RASTER_COLOR (in RGBA mode) or GL_CURRENT_RASTER_INDEX</H2><PRE>
(in  color index mode) is set to the color produced by the light­
ing calculation (see _cmnd(Light), _cmnd(LightModel), and
_cmnd(ShadeModel)).  If lighting is disabled, current  color  (in

</PRE>
<H2>RGBA  mode,  state  variable GL_CURRENT_COLOR) or color index (in</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>color index mode, state variable GL_CURRENT_INDEX) is used to up­</H2><PRE>
date      the      current      raster      color.      Likewise,

</PRE>
<H2>GL_CURRENT_RASTER_TEXTURE_COORDS is  updated  as  a  function  of</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>GL_CURRENT_TEXTURE_COORDS,  based  on  the texture matrix and the</H2><PRE>
texture generation functions (see _cmnd(TexGen)).   Finally,  the
distance from the origin of the eye coordinate system to the ver­
tex  as  transformed  by  only  the  modelview  matrix   replaces

</PRE>
<H2>GL_CURRENT_RASTER_DISTANCE.   Initially, the current raster posi­</H2><PRE>
tion is (0, 0, 0, 1), the current raster distance is 0, the valid
bit  is set, the associated RGBA color is (1, 1, 1, 1), the asso­
ciated color index is 1, and the associated  texture  coordinates

</PRE>
<H2>are  (0,  0, 0, 1).  In RGBA mode, GL_CURRENT_RASTER_INDEX is al­</H2><PRE>
ways 1; in color index mode, the current raster RGBA color always
maintains  its  initial  value.   The raster position is modified
both by _cmnd and by _cmnd(Bitmap).  When the raster position co­
ordinates  are  invalid,  drawing  commands that are based on the
raster position are ignored (that  is,  they  do  not  result  in
changes  to  GL  state).   Calling  _cmnd(DrawElements),  or _cm­
nd(DrawRangeElements) may leave the current color or index  inde­
terminate.  If _cmnd is executed while the current color or index
is indeterminate, the current raster color or current raster  in­
dex  remains  indeterminate.  To set a valid raster position out­
side the viewport, first set a valid raster position,  then  call
