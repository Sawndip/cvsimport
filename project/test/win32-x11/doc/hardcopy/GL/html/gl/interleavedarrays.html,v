_phead(_param2) Specifies the offset in bytes between each aggre­
gate array element.  _cmnd lets you specify and enable individual
color, normal, texture and vertex arrays whose elements are  part
of  a  larger aggregate array element.  For some implementations,
this is more efficient than specifying the arrays separately.  If
_param2  is  0,  the aggregate elements are stored consecutively.
Otherwise, _param2 bytes occur between the beginning of  one  ag­
gregate array element and the beginning of the next aggregate ar­
ray element.  _param1 serves as a ``key'' describing the  extrac­
tion  of  individual arrays from the aggregate array.  If _param1
contains a T, then texture coordinates are extracted from the in­
terleaved array.  If C is present, color values are extracted. If
N is present, normal coordinates are extracted.   Vertex  coordi­
nates  are  always  extracted.  The digits 2, 3, and 4 denote how
many values are extracted.  F indicates that values are extracted
as  floating-point values.  Colors may also be extracted as 4 un­
signed bytes if 4UB follows the C.  If a color is extracted as  4
unsigned bytes, the vertex array element which follows is located
at the first possible floating-point aligned address.   _cmnd  is
available  only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.  If _cmnd is
called while compiling a display list, it is  not  compiled  into
the  list, and it is executed immediately.  Execution of _cmnd is
not allowed between the execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the  corre­
sponding  execution of _cmnd(End), but an error may or may not be
generated. If no error is generated, the operation is  undefined.
_cmnd  is typically implemented on the client side.  Vertex array
parameters are client-side state and are therefore not  saved  or
restored  by  _cmnd(PushAttrib)  and  _cmnd(PopAttrib).  Use _cm­
nd(PushClientAttrib) and  _cmnd(PopClientAttrib)  instead.   When
