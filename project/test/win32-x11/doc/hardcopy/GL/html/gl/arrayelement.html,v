<H2>location _param1 of the enabled arrays. If GL_VERTEX_ARRAY is not</H2><PRE>
enabled,  no  drawing  occurs but the attributes corresponding to
the enabled arrays are modified.  Use _cmnd to  construct  primi­
tives  by  indexing vertex data, rather than by streaming through
arrays of data in first-to-last order. Because each  call  speci­
fies  only  a single vertex, it is possible to explicitly specify
per-primitive attributes such as a single normal  per  individual
triangle.   Changes  made  to array data between the execution of
_cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding execution  of  _cmnd(End)  may
affect  calls  to  _cmnd  that are made within the same _cmnd(Be­
gin)/_cmnd(End) period in non-sequential ways.  That is,  a  call
to
_cmnd that precedes a change to array data may access the changed
data, and a call that follows a change to array data  may  access
original  data.  _cmnd is available only if the GL version is 1.1
or greater.  _cmnd is included in display lists. If _cmnd is  en­
tered  into  a display list, the necessary array data (determined
by the array pointers and enables) is also entered into the  dis­
play list. Because the array pointers and enables are client-side
state, their values affect display lists when the lists are  cre­
ated,  not  when  the lists are executed.  _cmnd(ClientActiveTex­
tureARB), _cmnd(ColorPointer), _cmnd(DrawArrays), _cmnd(EdgeFlag­
Pointer),  _cmnd(GetPointerv),  _cmnd(IndexPointer), _cmnd(Inter­
leavedArrays), _cmnd(NormalPointer), _cmnd(TexCoordPointer), _cm­
nd(VertexPointer)
