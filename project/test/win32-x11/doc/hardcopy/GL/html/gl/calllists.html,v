The pointer type is  void  because  the  offsets  can  be  bytes,
shorts, ints, or floats, depending on the value of _param2.  _cm­
nd causes each display list  in  the  list  of  names  passed  as
_param3  to be executed.  As a result, the commands saved in each
display list are executed in order, just as if they  were  called
without  using  a display list.  Names of display lists that have
not been defined are ignored.  _cmnd provides an efficient  means
for  executing  more than one display list.  _param2 allows lists
with various name formats to be accepted.   The  formats  are  as

</PRE>
<H2>follows:  GL_BYTE _param3 is treated as an array of signed bytes,</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>each in the range -128 through 127.  GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE _param3  is</H2><PRE>
treated  as  an  array  of  unsigned  bytes,  each in the range 0

</PRE>
<H2>through 255.  GL_SHORT _param3 is treated as an array  of  signed</H2><PRE>
two-byte  integers,  each  in  the  range  -32768  through 32767.

</PRE>
<H2>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT _param3 is treated as an array of unsigned two-</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>byte integers, each in the range 0 through 65535.  GL_INT _param3</H2><PRE>
is  treated  as  an   array   of   signed   four-byte   integers.

</PRE>
<H2>GL_UNSIGNED_INT  _param3 is treated as an array of unsigned four-</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>byte integers.  GL_FLOAT _param3 is treated as an array of  four-</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>byte  floating-point values.  GL_2_BYTES _param3 is treated as an</H2><PRE>
array of unsigned bytes.  Each pair of bytes specifies  a  single
display-list  name.   The  value  of  the pair is computed as 256
times the unsigned value of the first byte plus the unsigned val­

</PRE>
<H2>ue of the second byte.  GL_3_BYTES _param3 is treated as an array</H2><PRE>
of unsigned bytes.  Each triplet of bytes specifies a single dis­
play-list  name.   The  value of the triplet is computed as 65536
times the unsigned value of the first byte, plus  256  times  the
unsigned value of the second byte, plus the unsigned value of the

</PRE>
<H2>third byte.  GL_4_BYTES _param3 is treated as  an  array  of  un­</H2><PRE>
signed  bytes.   Each quadruplet of bytes specifies a single dis­
play-list name.  The value  of  the  quadruplet  is  computed  as
16777216  times  the unsigned value of the first byte, plus 65536
times the unsigned value of the second byte, plus 256  times  the
unsigned  value of the third byte, plus the unsigned value of the
fourth byte.  The list of display-list names is  not  null-termi­
nated.   Rather, _param1 specifies how many names are to be taken
from _param3.  An additional level of indirection is made  avail­
able  with  the  _cmnd(ListBase)  command, which specifies an un­
signed offset that is added to each display-list  name  specified
in  _param3  before that display list is executed.  _cmnd can ap­
pear inside a display list.  To avoid the possibility of infinite
recursion  resulting  from  display  lists calling one another, a
limit is placed on the nesting level of display lists during dis­
play-list  execution.  This limit must be at least 64, and it de­
pends on the implementation.  GL state is not saved and  restored
across  a  call  to _cmnd.  Thus, changes made to GL state during
the execution of the display lists remain after execution is com­
pleted.   Use  _cmnd(PushAttrib), _cmnd(PopAttrib), _cmnd(PushMa­
trix), and _cmnd(PopMatrix) to preserve  GL  state  across  _cmnd
calls.  Display lists can be executed between a call to _cmnd(Be­
gin) and the corresponding call to _cmnd(End),  as  long  as  the
display  list includes only commands that are allowed in this in­
