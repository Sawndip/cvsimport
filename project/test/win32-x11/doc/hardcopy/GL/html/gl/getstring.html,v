<H2>release to release.  GL_RENDERER Returns the name of the  render­</H2><PRE>
er.   This  name is typically specific to a particular configura­
tion of a hardware platform.  It does not change from release  to

</PRE>
<H2>release.    GL_VERSION  Returns  a  version  or  release  number.</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>GL_EXTENSIONS Returns a space-separated list of supported  exten­</H2><PRE>
sions  to  GL.   Because  the GL does not include queries for the
performance characteristics of an implementation,  some  applica­
tions  are  written to recognize known platforms and modify their
GL usage based on  known  performance  characteristics  of  these

</PRE>
<H2>platforms.   Strings  GL_VENDOR and GL_RENDERER together uniquely</H2><PRE>
specify a platform. They do not change from  release  to  release
and  should be used by platform-recognition algorithms.  Some ap­
plications want to make use of features that are not part of  the
standard  GL.  These features may be implemented as extensions to

</PRE>
<H2>the standard GL.  The GL_EXTENSIONS string is  a  space-separated</H2><PRE>
list  of supported GL extensions.  (Extension names never contain

</PRE>
<H2>a space character.)  The GL_VERSION string begins with a  version</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>number.   The  version number uses one of these forms: major_num­</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>ber.minor_number</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>major_number.minor_number.release_number Vendor-specific informa­</H2><PRE>
tion may follow the version number. Its  depends on the implemen­
tation, but a space always separates the version number  and  the
vendor-specific  information.   All  strings are null-terminated.
If an error is generated, _cmnd returns 0.  The client and server
may  support  different versions or extensions.  _cmnd always re­
turns a compatible version number or list of extensions.  The re­

</PRE>
<H2>lease  number  always  describes  the server.  GL_INVALID_ENUM is</H2><PRE>
generated   if   _param1    is    not    an    accepted    value.

</PRE>
<H2>GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if _cmnd is executed between</H2><PRE>
the execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding execution  of
_cmnd(End).
