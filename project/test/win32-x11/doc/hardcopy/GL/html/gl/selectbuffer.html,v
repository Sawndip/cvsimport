<H2>GL_SELECT (see _cmnd(RenderMode)).  _cmnd must be  issued  before</H2><PRE>
selection  mode  is  enabled, and it must not be issued while the

</PRE>
<H2>rendering mode is GL_SELECT.  A programmer can use  selection  to</H2><PRE>
determine  which  primitives are drawn into some region of a win­
dow.  The region is defined by the current modelview and perspec­
tive  matrices.   In  selection mode, no pixel fragments are pro­
duced from rasterization.  Instead, if a primitive  or  a  raster
position  intersects  the  clipping volume defined by the viewing
frustum and the  user-defined  clipping  planes,  this  primitive
causes  a  selection  hit.   (With polygons, no hit occurs if the
polygon is culled.)  When a change is made to the name stack,  or
when  _cmnd(RenderMode)  is  called,  a  hit  record is copied to
_param2 if any hits have occurred since the last such event (name
stack change or _cmnd(RenderMode) call).  The hit record consists
of the number of names in the name  stack  at  the  time  of  the
event,  followed  by  the minimum and maximum depth values of all
vertices that hit since the previous event, followed by the  name
stack  contents,  bottom  name first.  Depth values (which are in
the range [0,1]) are multiplied by 2^32 - 1, before being  placed
in  the hit record.  An internal index into _param2 is reset to 0
whenever selection mode is entered.  Each time a  hit  record  is
copied  into  _param2,  the  index is incremented to point to the
cell just past the end of the block of names - that  is,  to  the
next available cell.  If the hit record is larger than the number
of remaining locations in _param2, as much data  as  can  fit  is
copied, and the overflow flag is set.  If the name stack is empty
when a hit record is copied, that record consists of  0  followed
by the minimum and maximum depth values.  To exit selection mode,

_param2, resets the overflow flag and the selection buffer point­
er, and initializes the name stack to be empty.  If the  overflow
bit  was  set  when  _cmnd(RenderMode) was called, a negative hit
record count is returned.  The contents of _param2  is  undefined
until  _cmnd(RenderMode)  is  called  with an argument other than
