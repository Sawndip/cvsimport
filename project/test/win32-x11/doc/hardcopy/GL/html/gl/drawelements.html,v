<H2>the  values  in  _param4.  Must  be  one   of   GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE,</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, or GL_UNSIGNED_INT.  _phead(_param4) Specifies</H2><PRE>
a pointer to the location where the indices  are  stored.   _cmnd
specifies  multiple geometric primitives with very few subroutine
calls. Instead of calling a GL function to pass  each  individual
vertex,  normal, texture coordinate, edge flag, or color, you can
prespecify separate arrays of vertexes, normals, and  so  on  and
use them to construct a sequence of primitives with a single call
to _cmnd.  When _cmnd is called, it uses _param2 sequential  ele­
ments  from  an enabled array, starting at _param4 to construct a
sequence of geometric primitives. _param1 specifies what kind  of
primitives  are constructed, and how the array elements construct
these primitives. If more than one  array  is  enabled,  each  is

</PRE>
<H2>used.  If GL_VERTEX_ARRAY is not enabled, no geometric primitives</H2><PRE>
are constructed.  Vertex attributes that are  modified  by  _cmnd
have  an  unspecified  value after _cmnd returns. For example, if

</PRE>
<H2>GL_COLOR_ARRAY is enabled, the value of the current color is  un­</H2><PRE>
defined  after  _cmnd  executes.  Attributes that aren't modified
maintain their previous values.  _cmnd is available only  if  the
GL  version  is  1.1  or  greater.   _cmnd is included in display
lists. If _cmnd is entered into a display list, the necessary ar­
ray  data  (determined by the array pointers and enables) is also
entered into the display list. Because the array pointers and en­
ables  are  client-side  state, their values affect display lists
when the lists are created, not  when  the  lists  are  executed.

</PRE>
<H2>GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated if _param1 is not an accepted value.</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>GL_INVALID_VALUE   is   generated   if   _param2   is   negative.</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if _cmnd is executed between</H2><PRE>
the execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the  corresponding  _cmnd(End).
