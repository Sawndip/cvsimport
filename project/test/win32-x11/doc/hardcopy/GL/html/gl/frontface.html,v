<H2>nd(Disable)  with  argument  GL_CULL_FACE.   The  projection of a</H2><PRE>
polygon to window coordinates is said to have  clockwise  winding
if  an imaginary object following the path from its first vertex,
its second vertex, and so on, to its  last  vertex,  and  finally
back  to  its  first vertex, moves in a clockwise direction about
the interior of the polygon.  The polygon's winding is said to be
counterclockwise  if the imaginary object following the same path
moves in a counterclockwise direction about the interior  of  the
polygon.  _cmnd specifies whether polygons with clockwise winding
