sponding to the near and far clipping planes.  _cmnd specifies  a
linear  mapping of the normalized depth coordinates in this range
to window depth coordinates.   Regardless  of  the  actual  depth
buffer implementation, window coordinate depth values are treated
as though they range from 0 through 1  (like  color  components).
Thus, the values accepted by _cmnd are both clamped to this range
before they are accepted.  The setting of  (0,1)  maps  the  near
plane  to 0 and the far plane to 1.  With this mapping, the depth
buffer range is fully utilized.  It is not necessary that _param1
be  less  than _param2.  Reverse mappings such as $_eqnparam1 ~=~
