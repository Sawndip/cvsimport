behavior, when there is room  for  interpretation,  can  be  con­
trolled  with  hints.   A  hint  is specified with two arguments.
_param1 is a symbolic constant indicating the behavior to be con­
trolled,  and _param2 is another symbolic constant indicating the
desired  behavior.  The  initial  value  for  each   _param1   is

</PRE>
<H2>GL_DONT_CARE.   _param2  can  be one of the following: GL_FASTEST</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>The most efficient option should be chosen.  GL_NICEST  The  most</H2><PRE>
correct,   or   highest   quality,   option   should  be  chosen.

</PRE>
<H2>GL_DONT_CARE No preference.  Though  the  implementation  aspects</H2><PRE>
that  can  be  hinted are well defined, the interpretation of the
hints depends on the implementation.  The hint aspects  that  can
be specified with _param1, along with suggested semantics, are as

</PRE>
<H2>follows: GL_FOG_HINT Indicates the accuracy of  fog  calculation.</H2><PRE>
If  per-pixel fog calculation is not efficiently supported by the

</PRE>
<H2>GL implementation, hinting GL_DONT_CARE or GL_FASTEST can  result</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>in  per-vertex  calculation  of fog effects.  GL_LINE_SMOOTH_HINT</H2><PRE>
Indicates the sampling quality of antialiased lines.  If a larger

</PRE>
<H2>filter  function is applied, hinting GL_NICEST can result in more</H2><PRE>
pixel   fragments   being   generated    during    rasterization,

</PRE>
<H2>GL_PERSPECTIVE_CORRECTION_HINT Indicates the quality of color and</H2><PRE>
texture coordinate interpolation.  If  perspective-corrected  pa­
rameter  interpolation is not efficiently supported by the GL im­

</PRE>
<H2>plementation, hinting GL_DONT_CARE or GL_FASTEST  can  result  in</H2><PRE>
simple linear interpolation of colors and/or texture coordinates.

</PRE>
<H2>GL_POINT_SMOOTH_HINT  Indicates  the  sampling  quality  of   an­</H2><PRE>
tialiased  points.  If a larger filter function is applied, hint­

</PRE>
<H2>ing GL_NICEST can result in more pixel fragments being  generated</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>during  rasterization,  GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH_HINT Indicates the sam­</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>pling quality of antialiased polygons.  Hinting GL_NICEST can re­</H2><PRE>
sult  in  more  pixel fragments being generated during rasteriza­
tion, if a larger filter function is applied.  The interpretation
of hints depends on the implementation.  Some implementations ig­

</PRE>
<H2>nore _cmnd(Hint) settings.  GL_INVALID_ENUM is generated  if  ei­</H2><PRE>
ther   _param1   or   _param2   is   not   an   accepted   value.

</PRE>
<H2>GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if _cmnd  is  executed  between</H2><PRE>
the  execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding execution of
_cmnd(End).
