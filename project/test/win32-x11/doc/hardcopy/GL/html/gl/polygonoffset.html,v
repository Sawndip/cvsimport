<H2>GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_POINT is enabled, each fragment's  depth  value</H2><PRE>
will  be offset after it is interpolated from the <I>depth</I> values of
the appropriate vertices.  The value of the offset is $_eqnparam1
~*~  DZ  ~~+~~ r ~*~ _eqnparam2$, where $DZ~$ is a measurement of
the change in depth relative to the screen area of  the  polygon,
and $r$ is the smallest value that is guaranteed to produce a re­
solvable offset for a given implementation.  The offset is  added
before  the depth test is performed and before the value is writ­
ten into the depth buffer.  _cmnd is useful for rendering hidden-
line  images,  for applying decals to surfaces, and for rendering
solids with highlighted edges.  _cmnd is available only if the GL
version  is 1.1 or greater.  _cmnd has no effect on depth coordi­
nates placed in the feedback buffer.  _cmnd has no effect on  se­

</PRE>
<H2>lection.   GL_INVALID_OPERATION is generated if _cmnd is executed</H2><PRE>
between the execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding  exe­
cution of _cmnd(End).
