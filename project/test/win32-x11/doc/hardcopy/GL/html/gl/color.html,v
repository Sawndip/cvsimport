The GL stores both a current single-valued color index and a cur­
rent  four-valued  RGBA color.  _cmnd sets a new four-valued RGBA
color.  _cmnd has two  major  variants:  _cmnd(Color3)  and  _cm­
nd(Color4).   _cmnd(Color3)  variants specify new red, green, and
blue values explicitly and set the current  alpha  value  to  1.0
(full  intensity) implicitly.  _cmnd(Color4) variants specify all
four color  components  explicitly.   _cmnd(Color3b),  _cmnd(Col­
or4b),  _cmnd(Color3s),  _cmnd(Color4s), _cmnd(Color3i), and _cm­
nd(Color4i) take three or four signed byte, short, or long  inte­

<H2>gers  as  arguments.   When  v is appended to the name, the color</H2><PRE>
commands can take a pointer to an array of such values.   Current
color values are stored in floating-point , with unspecified man­
tissa and exponent sizes.   Unsigned  integer  color  components,
when specified, are linearly mapped to floating-point values such
that the largest representable value maps to 1.0  (full  intensi­
ty),  and  0  maps to 0.0 (zero intensity).  Signed integer color
components, when specified, are linearly mapped to floating-point
values  such  that  the most positive representable value maps to
1.0, and the most negative  representable  value  maps  to  -1.0.
(Note  that  this  mapping  does not convert 0 precisely to 0.0.)
Floating-point values are  mapped  directly.   Neither  floating-
point  nor  signed  integer values are clamped to the range [0,1]
before the current color is updated.  However,  color  components
are clamped to this range before they are interpolated or written
into a color buffer.  The initial value for the current color  is
(1,  1, 1, 1).  The current color can be updated at any time.  In
particular, _cmnd can be called between a  call  to  _cmnd(Begin)
and  the corresponding call to _cmnd(End).  _cmnd(Get) with argu­
