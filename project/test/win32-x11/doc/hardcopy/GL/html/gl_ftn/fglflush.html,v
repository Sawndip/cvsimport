plete in finite time.  Because any GL program might  be  executed
over  a  network, or on an accelerator that buffers commands, all
programs should call _cmnd whenever they count on having  all  of
their  previously  issued  commands completed.  For example, call
_cmnd before waiting for user input that depends on the generated
image.  _cmnd can return at any time.  It does not wait until the
execution of all  previously  issued  GL  commands  is  complete.

</PRE>
<H2>GL_INVALID_OPERATION  is  generated  if _cmnd is executed between</H2><PRE>
the execution of _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding execution  of
_cmnd(End).  _cmnd(Finish)
