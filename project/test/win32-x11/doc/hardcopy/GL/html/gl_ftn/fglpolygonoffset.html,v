<H2>SET_POINT is enabled, each fragment's depth value will be  offset</H2><PRE>
after it is interpolated from the <I>depth</I> values of the appropriate
vertices.  The value of the offset is $_eqnparam1 ~*~ DZ ~~+~~  r
~*~  _eqnparam2$,  where  $DZ~$ is a measurement of the change in
depth relative to the screen area of the polygon, and $r$ is  the
smallest  value that is guaranteed to produce a resolvable offset
for a given implementation.  The offset is added before the depth
test  is performed and before the value is written into the depth
buffer.  _cmnd is useful for rendering  hidden-line  images,  for
applying  decals to surfaces, and for rendering solids with high­
lighted edges.  _cmnd is available only if the GL version is  1.1
or  greater.   _cmnd has no effect on depth coordinates placed in

</PRE>
<H2>the feedback buffer.  _cmnd has no effect on  selection.   GL_IN­</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>VALID_OPERATION is generated if _cmnd is executed between the ex­</H2><PRE>
ecution of _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding execution  of  _cm­
nd(End).
