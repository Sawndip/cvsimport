3D position in window coordinates.   This  position,  called  the
raster position, is used to position pixel and bitmap write oper­
ations. It  is  maintained  with  subpixel  accuracy.   See  _cm­
nd(Bitmap),  _cmnd(DrawPixels),  and _cmnd(CopyPixels).  The cur­
rent raster position consists of three window  coordinates  ($x$,
$y$,  $z$), a clip coordinate value ($w$), an eye coordinate dis­
tance, a valid bit, and associated color data and texture coordi­
nates.   The  $w$ coordinate is a clip coordinate, because $w$ is
not projected to window coordinates.  _cmnd(RasterPos4) specifies
object  coordinates  $x$,  $y$,  $z$,  and  $w$ explicitly.  _cm­
nd(RasterPos3) specifies object coordinate $x$, $y$, and $z$  ex­
plicitly,  while  $w$  is implicitly set to 1.  _cmnd(RasterPos2)
uses the argument values for $x$ and $y$ while implicitly setting
$z$ and $w$ to 0 and 1.  The object coordinates presented by _cm­
nd are treated just like those of a _cmnd(Vertex)  command:  They
are  transformed by the current modelview and projection matrices
and passed to the clipping stage.  If the vertex is  not  culled,
then  it is projected and scaled to window coordinates, which be­

<H2>come  the  new  current  raster   position,   and   the   GL_CUR­</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>RENT_RASTER_POSITION_VALID  flag  is  set.  If the vertex culled,</H2><PRE>
then the valid bit is cleared and the current raster position and
associated color and texture coordinates are undefined.  The cur­
rent raster position also includes some associated color data and

</PRE>
<H2>texture  coordinates.   If  lighting  is  enabled,  then  GL_CUR­</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>RENT_RASTER_COLOR (in RGBA mode) or  GL_CURRENT_RASTER_INDEX  (in</H2><PRE>
color  index  mode)  is set to the color produced by the lighting
calculation (see _cmnd(Light), _cmnd(LightModel), and
_cmnd(ShadeModel)).  If lighting is disabled, current  color  (in

</PRE>
<H2>RGBA  mode,  state  variable GL_CURRENT_COLOR) or color index (in</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>color index mode, state variable GL_CURRENT_INDEX) is used to up­</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>date  the current raster color.  Likewise, GL_CURRENT_RASTER_TEX­</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>TURE_COORDS is updated as a  function  of  GL_CURRENT_TEXTURE_CO­</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>ORDS,  based  on  the  texture  matrix and the texture generation</H2><PRE>
functions (see _cmnd(TexGen)).  Finally, the  distance  from  the
origin  of the eye coordinate system to the vertex as transformed

</PRE>
<H2>by only the modelview matrix replaces GL_CURRENT_RASTER_DISTANCE.</H2><PRE>
Initially,  the current raster position is (0, 0, 0, 1), the cur­
rent raster distance is 0, the valid bit is set,  the  associated
RGBA  color is (1, 1, 1, 1), the associated color index is 1, and
the associated texture coordinates are (0, 0,  0,  1).   In  RGBA

</PRE>
<H2>mode,  GL_CURRENT_RASTER_INDEX  is always 1; in color index mode,</H2><PRE>
the current raster RGBA color always maintains its initial value.
The  raster  position  is  modified  both  by  _cmnd  and by _cm­
nd(Bitmap).  When the raster position  coordinates  are  invalid,
drawing  commands  that  are based on the raster position are ig­
nored (that is, they do not  result  in  changes  to  GL  state).
Calling   _cmnd(DrawElements),  or  _cmnd(DrawRangeElements)  may
leave the current color or index indeterminate.  If _cmnd is exe­
cuted while the current color or index is indeterminate, the cur­
rent raster color or current raster index remains  indeterminate.
To  set a valid raster position outside the viewport, first set a
valid raster position, then call _cmnd(Bitmap) with NULL  as  the
ord), _cmnd(TexGen), _cmnd(Vertex)
