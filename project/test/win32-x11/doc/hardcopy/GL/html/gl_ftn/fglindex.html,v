floating-point value.  Integer values are converted  directly  to
floating-point values, with no special mapping.  The initial val­
ue is 1.  Index values outside the  representable  range  of  the
color  index buffer are not clamped.  However, before an index is
dithered (if enabled) and written to the frame buffer, it is con­
verted to fixed-point format.  Any bits in the integer portion of
the resulting fixed-point value that do not correspond to bits in
the frame buffer are masked out.  _cmnd(Indexub) and _cmnd(Index­
ubv) are available only if the GL version is 1.1 or greater.  The
current  index  can be updated at any time.  In particular, _cmnd
can be called between a call to _cmnd(Begin) and the  correspond­
