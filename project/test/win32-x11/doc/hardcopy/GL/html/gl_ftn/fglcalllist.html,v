of infinite recursion resulting from display  lists  calling  one
another,  a limit is placed on the nesting level of display lists
during display-list execution.  This limit is at least 64, and it
depends  on  the  implementation.   GL state is not saved and re­
stored across a call to _cmnd.  Thus, changes made  to  GL  state
during  the execution of a display list remain after execution of
the display  list  is  completed.   Use  _cmnd(PushAttrib),  _cm­
nd(PopAttrib),  _cmnd(PushMatrix),  and  _cmnd(PopMatrix) to pre­
serve GL state across _cmnd calls.  Display lists can be executed
between a call to _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding call to _cm­
nd(End), as long as the display list includes only commands  that
are   allowed   in   this  interval.   _cmnd(Get)  with  argument
