dices to be rendered.  _cmnd specifies multiple geometric  primi­
tives  with  very  few  subroutine calls. Instead of calling a GL
procedure to pass each individual vertex, normal, texture coordi­
nate,  edge flag, or color, you can prespecify separate arrays of
vertexes, normals, and colors and use them  to  construct  a  se­
quence  of primitives with a single call to _cmnd.  When _cmnd is
called, it uses _param3 sequential elements from each enabled ar­
ray  to  construct  a sequence of geometric primitives, beginning
with element _param2. _param1 specifies what kind  of  primitives
are constructed, and how the array elements construct those prim­

tives are generated.  Vertex attributes that are modified by _cm­
nd have an unspecified value after _cmnd returns. For example, if

defined after _cmnd executes. Attributes that aren't modified re­
main  well defined.  _cmnd is available only if the GL version is
1.1 or greater.  _cmnd is included in display lists. If _cmnd  is
entered into a display list, the necessary array data (determined
by the array pointers and enables) is also entered into the  dis­
play list. Because the array pointers and enables are client-side
state, their values affect display lists when the lists are  cre­
