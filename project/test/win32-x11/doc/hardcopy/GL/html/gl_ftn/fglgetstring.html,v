<H2>lease.  GL_RENDERER Returns the name of the renderer.  This  name</H2><PRE>
is typically specific to a particular configuration of a hardware

<H2>platform.  It does not change from release to  release.   GL_VER­</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>SION  Returns a version or release number.  GL_EXTENSIONS Returns</H2><PRE>
a space-separated list of supported extensions  to  GL.   Because
the  GL does not include queries for the performance characteris­
tics of an implementation, some applications are written to  rec­
ognize  known  platforms and modify their GL usage based on known

</PRE>
<H2>performance characteristics of these platforms.  Strings  GL_VEN­</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>DOR and GL_RENDERER together uniquely specify a platform. They do</H2><PRE>
not change from release to release and should be  used  by  plat­
form-recognition  algorithms.  Some applications want to make use
of features that are not part of the standard GL. These  features

</PRE>
<H2>may  be implemented as extensions to the standard GL.  The GL_EX­</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>TENSIONS string is a space-separated list of supported GL  exten­</H2><PRE>
sions.   (Extension  names never contain a space character.)  The

</PRE>
<H2>GL_VERSION string begins with a version number.  The version num­</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>ber uses one of these forms: major_number.minor_number</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>major_number.minor_number.release_number Vendor-specific informa­</H2><PRE>
tion may follow the version number. Its format depends on the im­
plementation, but a space always separates the version number and
the vendor-specific information.  All strings are  null-terminat­
ed.   If  an error is generated, _cmnd returns 0.  The client and
server may support different versions or extensions.   _cmnd  al­
ways  returns  a compatible version number or list of extensions.

</PRE>
<H2>The release number always describes the server.   GL_INVALID_ENUM</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>is generated if _param1 is not an accepted value.  GL_INVALID_OP­</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>ERATION is generated if _cmnd is executed between  the  execution</H2><PRE>
of _cmnd(Begin) and the corresponding execution of _cmnd(End).
