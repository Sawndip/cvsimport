signs the _param1 texture priorities  given  in  _param3  to  the
_param1  textures named in _param2.  The GL establishes a ``work­
ing set'' of textures that are resident in texture memory.  These
textures  may  be bound to a texture target much more efficiently
than textures that are not resident.  By  specifying  a  priority
for  each  texture, _cmnd allows applications to guide the GL im­
plementation in determining which textures  should  be  resident.
The  priorities  given  in _param3 are clamped to the range [0,1]
before they are assigned.  0 indicates the lowest priority;  tex­
tures  with  priority 0 are least likely to be resident.  1 indi­
cates the highest priority; textures with  priority  1  are  most
likely  to  be resident.  However, textures are not guaranteed to
be resident until they are used.  _cmnd silently ignores attempts
to prioritize texture 0, or any texture name that does not corre­
spond to an existing texture.  _cmnd does not require that any of
the textures named by _param2 be bound to a texture target.  _cm­
nd(TexParameter) may also be used to set  a  texture's  priority,
but only if the texture is currently bound.  This is the only way
to set the priority of a default texture.  _cmnd is available on­
