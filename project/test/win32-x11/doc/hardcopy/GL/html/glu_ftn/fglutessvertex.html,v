calls describe a closed  contour.  For  example,  to  describe  a
quadrilateral  _cmnd should be called four times.  _cmnd can only
be called between _cmnd(TessBeginContour)  and  _cmnd(TessEndCon­
tour).   _param3  normally  points  to a structure containing the
vertex location, as well as other per-vertex attributes  such  as
color  and  normal.   This  pointer  is  passed  back to the user

</PRE>
<H2>through the GLU_TESS_VERTEX or GLU_TESS_VERTEX_DATA callback  af­</H2><PRE>
ter tessellation (see the _cmnd(TessCallback) reference page).  A
quadrilateral with a triangular hole in it can  be  described  as
follows:

gluTessBeginPolygon(tobj, NULL);
 gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v1, v1);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v2, v2);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v3, v3);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v4, v4);
 gluTessEndContour(tobj);
 gluTessBeginContour(tobj);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v5, v5);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v6, v6);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v7, v7);
 gluTessEndContour(tobj); gluTessEndPolygon(tobj);

It  is  a  common  error  to  use a local variable for _param2 or
_param3 and store values into it as part of a loop.  For example:
for (i = 0; i &lt; NVERTICES; ++i) {
  GLdouble data[3];
  data[0] = vertex[i][0];
  data[1] = vertex[i][1];
  data[2] = vertex[i][2];
  gluTessVertex(tobj, data, data);
  } This doesn't work.  Because the pointers specified by _param2
and _param3 might not be dereferenced until _cmnd(TessEndPolygon)
is  executed,  all  the  vertex coordinates but the very last set
could be overwritten  before  tessellation  begins.   Two  common
symptoms  of  this problem are consists of a single point (when a

<H2>local variable is used  for  _param3)  and  a  GLU_TESS_NEED_COM­</H2><PRE>

<H2>BINE_CALLBACK  error (when a local variable is used for _param2).</H2><PRE>
_cmnd(TessBeginPolygon), _cmnd(NewTess), _cmnd(TessBeginContour),
_cmnd(TessCallback), _cmnd(TessProperty), _cmnd(TessNormal), _cm­
