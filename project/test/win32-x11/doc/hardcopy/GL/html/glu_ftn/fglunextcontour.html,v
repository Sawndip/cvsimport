nd(TessVertex) calls, a _cmnd call indicates  that  the  previous
contour  is complete and that the next contour is about to begin.
Another series of _cmnd(TessVertex) calls is  then  used  to  de­
scribe  the  new  contour. This process can be repeated until all
contours have been described.  _param2 defines what type of  con­

</PRE>
<H2>tour  follows.  The legal contour types are as follows: GLU_EXTE­</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>RIOR An exterior contour defines  an  exterior  boundary  of  the</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>polygon.   GLU_INTERIOR  An  interior contour defines an interior</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>boundary of the polygon (such as a hole).  GLU_UNKNOWN An unknown</H2><PRE>
contour is analyzed by the library to determine if it is interior

</PRE>
<H2>or exterior.  GLU_CCW, GLU_CW The first GLU_CCW or GLU_CW contour</H2><PRE>
defined is considered to be exterior. All other contours are con­
sidered to be exterior if they are oriented in the same direction
(clockwise or counterclockwise) as the first contour, and interi­

</PRE>
<H2>or if they are not.  If one contour is of type GLU_CCW or GLU_CW,</H2><PRE>
then all contours must be of the same type (if they are not, then

</PRE>
<H2>all GLU_CCW and GLU_CW contours will be changed to  GLU_UNKNOWN).</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>Note  that  there  is  no real difference between the GLU_CCW and</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>GLU_CW contour types.  Before the  first  contour  is  described,</H2><PRE>
_cmnd  can be called to define the type of the first contour.  If
_cmnd is not called before the first contour, then the first con­

</PRE>
<H2>tour  is  marked  GLU_EXTERIOR.   This command is obsolete and is</H2><PRE>
provided for backward compatibility  only.  Calls  to  _cmnd  are
mapped  to  _cmnd(TessEndContour) followed by _cmnd(TessBeginCon­
tour).  A quadrilateral with a triangular hole in it can  be  de­
scribed as follows:

gluBeginPolygon(tobj);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v1, v1);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v2, v2);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v3, v3);
   gluTessVertex(tobj,  v4, v4); gluNextContour(tobj, GLU_INTERI­
OR);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v5, v5);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v6, v6);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v7, v7); gluEndPolygon(tobj); _cmnd(Begin­
Polygon), _cmnd(NewTess), _cmnd(TessCallback), _cmnd(TessVertex),
_cmnd(TessBeginContour)
