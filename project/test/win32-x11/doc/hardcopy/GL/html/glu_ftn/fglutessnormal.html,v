projected onto a plane perpendicular to one of the three  coordi­
nate  axes  before  tessellation and all output triangles will be
oriented CCW with respect to the normal (CW  orientation  can  be
obtained by reversing the sign of the supplied normal). For exam­
ple, if you know that all polygons lie in  the  x-y  plane,  call
_cmnd(TessNormal)(tess, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) before rendering any poly­
gons.  If the supplied normal is (0.0,  0.0,  0.0)  (the  initial
value), the normal is determined as follows. The direction of the
normal, up to its sign, is found by fitting a plane to  the  ver­
tices,  without  regard  to how the vertices are connected. It is
expected that the input data lies  approximately  in  the  plane;
otherwise,  projection  perpendicular to one of the three coordi­
nate axes may substantially change the geometry. The sign of  the
normal is chosen so that the sum of the signed areas of all input
contours is nonnegative (where a CCW contour has positive  area).
The  supplied normal persists until it is changed by another call
to  _cmnd(TessNormal).   _cmnd(TessBeginPolygon),  _cmnd(TessEnd­
Polygon)
