_phead(_param5) Specifies an array of _param4 nondecreasing  knot
values  in the parametric <I>v</I> direction.  _phead(_param6) Specifies
the offset (as a number of single-precision floating  point  val­
ues) between successive control points in the parametric <I>u</I> direc­
tion in _param8.  _phead(_param7) Specifies the offset  (in  sin­
gle-precision  floating-point  values) between successive control
points in the parametric <I>v</I> direction in _param8.  _phead(_param8)
Specifies  an  array containing control points for the NURBS sur­
face.  The offsets between successive control points in the para­
metric  <I>u</I>  and  <I>v</I>  directions  are  given by _param6 and _param7.
_phead(_param9) Specifies the order of the NURBS surface  in  the
parametric  <I>u</I>  direction.  The order is one more than the degree,
hence a surface  that  is  cubic  in  <I>u</I>  has  a  <I>u</I>  order  of  4.
_phead(_param10)  Specifies the order of the NURBS surface in the
parametric <I>v</I> direction. The order is one more  than  the  degree,
hence  a  surface  that  is  cubic  in  <I>v</I>  has  a  <I>v</I>  order of 4.
_phead(_param11) Specifies type of the surface. _param11  can  be
any  of  the  valid  two-dimensional  evaluator  types  (such  as

</PRE>
<H2>GL_MAP2_VERTEX_3 or GL_MAP2_COLOR_4).  Use _cmnd within  a  NURBS</H2><PRE>
(Non-Uniform  Rational  B-Spline)  surface definition to describe
the shape of a NURBS surface (before any trimming). To  mark  the
beginning  of a NURBS surface definition, use the _cmnd(BeginSur­
face) command.  To mark the end of a  NURBS  surface  definition,
use the _cmnd(EndSurface) command. Call _cmnd within a NURBS sur­
face definition only.  Positional, texture, and color coordinates
are  associated  with  a surface by presenting each as a separate
_cmnd between a  _cmnd(BeginSurface)/_cmnd(EndSurface)  pair.  No
more than one call to _cmnd for each of color, position, and tex­
ture data can be made within  a  single  _cmnd(BeginSurface)/_cm­
nd(EndSurface)  pair.  Exactly  one call must be made to describe

</PRE>
<H2>the position of the surface (a _param11  of  GL_MAP2_VERTEX_3  or</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>GL_MAP2_VERTEX_4).   A  NURBS surface can be trimmed by using the</H2><PRE>
commands _cmnd(NurbsCurve) and _cmnd(PwlCurve) between  calls  to
_cmnd(BeginTrim)  and  _cmnd(EndTrim).   Note  that  a _cmnd with
_param2 knots in the <I>u</I> direction and _param4 knots in the  <I>v</I>  di­
rection  with  orders  _param9  and _param10 must have (_param2 -
_param9) $times$ (_param4 - _param10) control points.   The  fol­
lowing commands render a textured NURBS surface with normals; the
texture coordinates and normals are also NURBS surfaces:

gluBeginSurface(nobj);
   gluNurbsSurface(nobj, ..., GL_MAP2_TEXTURE_COORD_2);
   gluNurbsSurface(nobj, ..., GL_MAP2_NORMAL);
   gluNurbsSurface(nobj,   ...,   GL_MAP2_VERTEX_4);   gluEndSur­
face(nobj);

_cmnd(BeginSurface),  _cmnd(BeginTrim),  _cmnd(NewNurbsRenderer),
_cmnd(NurbsCurve), _cmnd(PwlCurve)
