nd(TessVertex) calls, a _cmnd call indicates  that  the  previous
contour  is complete and that the next contour is about to begin.
Another series of _cmnd(TessVertex) calls is  then  used  to  de­
scribe  the  new  contour. This process can be repeated until all
contours have been described.  _param2 defines what type of  con­
tour   follows.    The   legal  contour  types  are  as  follows:

</PRE>
<H2>GLU_EXTERIOR An exterior contour defines an exterior boundary  of</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>the polygon.  GLU_INTERIOR An interior contour defines an interi­</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>or boundary of the polygon (such as a hole).  GLU_UNKNOWN An  un­</H2><PRE>
known  contour  is  analyzed by the library to determine if it is

</PRE>
<H2>interior or exterior.   GLU_CCW,  GLU_CW  The  first  GLU_CCW  or</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>GLU_CW  contour  defined  is considered to be exterior. All other</H2><PRE>
contours are considered to be exterior if they  are  oriented  in
the  same  direction (clockwise or counterclockwise) as the first
contour, and interior if they are not.  If one contour is of type

</PRE>
<H2>GLU_CCW or GLU_CW, then all contours must be of the same type (if</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>they are not, then  all  GLU_CCW  and  GLU_CW  contours  will  be</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>changed  to  GLU_UNKNOWN).  Note that there is no real difference</H2><PRE>

</PRE>
<H2>between the GLU_CCW and GLU_CW contour types.  Before  the  first</H2><PRE>
contour  is  described, _cmnd can be called to define the type of
the first contour.  If _cmnd is not called before the first  con­

</PRE>
<H2>tour,  then  the first contour is marked GLU_EXTERIOR.  This com­</H2><PRE>
mand is obsolete and is provided for backward compatibility only.
Calls  to  _cmnd  are mapped to _cmnd(TessEndContour) followed by
_cmnd(TessBeginContour).  A quadrilateral with a triangular  hole
in it can be described as follows:

gluBeginPolygon(tobj);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v1, v1);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v2, v2);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v3, v3);
   gluTessVertex(tobj,  v4, v4); gluNextContour(tobj, GLU_INTERI­
OR);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v5, v5);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v6, v6);
   gluTessVertex(tobj, v7, v7); gluEndPolygon(tobj); _cmnd(Begin­
Polygon), _cmnd(NewTess), _cmnd(TessCallback), _cmnd(TessVertex),
_cmnd(TessBeginContour)
