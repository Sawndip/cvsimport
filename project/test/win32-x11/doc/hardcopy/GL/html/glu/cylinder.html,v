subdivisions along the <I>z</I> axis.  _cmnd draws a  cylinder  oriented
along  the  <I>z</I>  axis. The base of the cylinder is placed at <I>z</I> = 0,
and the top at $ z ~=~ _eqnparam4 $. Like a sphere, a cylinder is
subdivided  around  the  <I>z</I> axis into slices, and along the <I>z</I> axis
into stacks.  Note that if _param3 is set to  0.0,  this  routine

</PRE>
<H2>generates a cone.  If the orientation is set to GLU_OUTSIDE (with</H2><PRE>
_cmnd(QuadricOrientation)), then any generated normals point away
from  the  <I>z</I>  axis.  Otherwise, they point toward the <I>z</I> axis.  If
texturing is turned on (with _cmnd(QuadricTexture)), then texture
coordinates are generated so that <I>t</I> ranges linearly from 0.0 at <I>z</I>
= 0 to 1.0 at <I>z</I> = _param4, and <I>s</I> ranges from 0.0 at the +<I>y</I>  axis,
to  0.25 at the +<I>x</I> axis, to 0.5 at the -<I>y</I> axis, to 0.75 at the -<I>x</I>
axis, and  back  to  1.0  at  the  +<I>y</I>  axis.   _cmnd(Disk),  _cm­
nd(NewQuadric),  _cmnd(PartialDisk),  _cmnd(QuadricTexture), _cm­
nd(Sphere)
