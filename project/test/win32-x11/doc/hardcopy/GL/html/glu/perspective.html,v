Specifies the distance from the viewer to the far clipping  plane
(always  positive).   _cmnd  specifies a viewing frustum into the
world coordinate system.  In general, the aspect ratio  in  _cmnd
should match the aspect ratio of the associated viewport. For ex­
ample, $ _eqnparam2 ~=~ 2.0 $ means the viewer's angle of view is
twice  as  wide  in <I>x</I> as it is in <I>y</I>.  If the viewport is twice as
wide as it is tall, it displays  the  image  without  distortion.
The matrix generated by _cmnd is multipled by the current matrix,
just as if _glcmnd(MultMatrix) were called with the generated ma­
trix.   To  load  the  perspective matrix onto the current matrix
stack instead, precede the call to _cmnd with a  call  to  _glcm­
nd(LoadIdentity).  Given <I>f</I> defined as follows:

            f  ~=~ cotangent"("{_eqnparam1 over 2}")"






































   ccol { 0 above 0 above {{2 *  _eqnparam4  *  _eqnparam3}  over
{_eqnparam3 - _eqnparam4}} above 0} }}  ~~~ right )

Depth  buffer  precision  is affected by the values specified for
_param3 and _param4.  The greater the ratio of _param4 to _param3
is, the less effective the depth buffer will be at distinguishing
between surfaces that are near each other.  If

               $r ~=~ _eqnparam4 over _eqnparam3$

roughly $log sub 2 r$ bits of depth buffer  precision  are  lost.
Because  $r$ approaches infinity as _param3 approaches 0, _param3
must never be set to 0.  _glcmnd(Frustum), _glcmnd(LoadIdentity),
_glcmnd(MultMatrix), _cmnd(Ortho2D)
