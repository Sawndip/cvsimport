ders a disk on the <I>z</I> = 0 plane. The disk has a radius of _param3,
and contains a concentric circular hole with a radius of _param2.
If _param2 is 0, then no hole is generated. The disk is subdivid­
ed  around  the  <I>z</I> axis into slices (like pizza slices), and also
about the <I>z</I> axis into rings (as specified by _param4 and _param5,
respectively).   With  respect to orientation, the +<I>z</I> side of the
disk is considered to  be  "outside"  (see  _cmnd(QuadricOrienta­
tion)).    This   means   that  if  the  orientation  is  set  to

</PRE>
<H2>GLU_OUTSIDE, then any normals generated point along the +z  axis.</H2><PRE>
Otherwise,  they  point along the -<I>z</I> axis.  If texturing has been
turned on (with _cmnd(QuadricTexture)), texture  coordinates  are
generated linearly such that where $ r ~=~ _eqnparam3 $, the val­
ue at (<I>r</I>, 0, 0) is (1, 0.5), at (0, <I>r</I>, 0) it is (0.5, 1), at (-<I>r</I>,
0,  0)  it  is  (0, 0.5), and at (0, -<I>r</I>, 0) it is (0.5, 0).  _cm­
nd(Cylinder),   _cmnd(NewQuadric),    _cmnd(PartialDisk),    _cm­
nd(QuadricOrientation), _cmnd(QuadricTexture), _cmnd(Sphere)
