gion of the viewport.  This is typically useful to determine what
objects  are  being drawn near the cursor.  Use _cmnd to restrict
drawing to a small region around the cursor.  Then, enter  selec­
tion mode (with _glcmnd(RenderMode)) and rerender the scene.  All
primitives that would have been drawn near the cursor are identi­
fied  and  stored in the selection buffer.  The matrix created by
_cmnd is multiplied by the  current  matrix  just  as  if  _glcm­
nd(MultMatrix)  is  called  with the generated matrix.  To effec­
tively use the generated pick  matrix  for  picking,  first  call
_glcmnd(LoadIdentity)  to  load  an identity matrix onto the per­
spective matrix stack.  Then call _cmnd, and finally, call a com­
mand (such as _cmnd(Perspective)) to multiply the perspective ma­
trix by the pick matrix.  When using  _cmnd  to  pick  NURBS,  be

way it was subdivided without the pick matrix.
