@Added files comprising RDA.

@RDA hack rules:

The RDA package is used by several programs, so it is important to
keep the external interface of the lib part as stable as possible.  

Since some programs that depend on RDA are kept in separate source
trees, it is not easy to test whether changes to the lib/ directory will
regress them.  Each proposed change to devo/remote/lib should be tested
by building:
	remote/samples
	sid/component/gdb
and running gdb against the code.  Submit patches to the MAINTAINERS.  

You are welcome to create new subdirectories for applications that use
this library.

Discussion of this package is held at
	gdb@@sourceware.cygnus.com


TODO:

New sample server programs for remote/samples.

Convert RDA into an optionally installable library,
with tidied-up headers.

MAN pages.

Test suite.

Ports to more hosts.



add --enable-build-warnings.
See bfd for how to have it work with automake.
