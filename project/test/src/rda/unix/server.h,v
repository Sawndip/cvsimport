* stock-breakpoints.h: New files.
* gdbserv-thread-db.h (continue_lwp, singlestep_lwp, attach_lwp)
(stop_lwp): Move these ...
* lwp-ctrl.h: ... to here (new file).
* server.h (struct child_process): Include a pointer to the
architecture object, a breakpoint table, and a pointer to the
"focus thread".
* linux-target.c: Create architecture objects for the i386 and
FRV, and describe breakpoints for those architectures.
#include "arch.h".
[STOCK_BREAKPOINTS]: #include "stock-breakpoints.h".
(allocate_empty_arch): New function.
[X86_LINUX_TARGET] (stock_table_to_x86, x86_table_to_stock)
(stock_bp_to_x86, x86_bp_to_stock, x86_make_bp_table, x86_set_bp)
(x86_delete_bp, x86_bp_hit_p, x86_make_arch): New functions.
(MAKE_ARCH): #define to call x86_make_arch.
[X86_LINUX_TARGET] (stock_table_to_frv, frv_table_to_stock)
(stock_bp_to_frv, frv_bp_to_stock, frv_make_bp_table, frv_set_bp)
(frv_delete_bp, frv_bp_hit_p, frv_make_arch): New functions.
(MAKE_ARCH): #define to call frv_make_arch.
(linux_attach): If MAKE_ARCH is #defined, create an architecture
object for this process.  And if we have an architecture object,
make a breakpoint table.
* thread-db.c: #include <assert.h>, "arch.h", "lwp-ctrl.h", and
"lwp-pool.h".
(struct gdbserv_thread): Remove state-tracking flags 'attached',
'stopped', 'waited', and 'stepping'; all that state is handled
inside lwp-pool.c now.
(add_thread_to_list): Zero the entire newly allocated thread
structure.
(thread_list_lookup_by_lid): Prefer threads whose ti_lid values
are different from that of the main process.
(thread_db_state_str, thread_db_type_str): Don't include
formatting spaces here.
(thread_db_event_str): New function.
(thread_debug_name): New function.
(get_thread_signals): Return a value indicating success or failure.
(ignore_thread_signal): New function.
(using_thread_db_events, create_notification, death_notification)

(insert_thread_db_event_breakpoints)
(delete_thread_db_event_breakpoints, request_thread_db_events)
(hit_thread_db_event_breakpoint, handle_thread_db_event): New
variables and functions, for using libthread_db's event interface.
(thread_db_open): Gather error-handling code next to the operation
that might fail.  Decide here whether to use the signal-based
debugging interface, or the event-based debugging interface.
(stop_thread, stop_all_threads, struct event_list, pending_events)
(pending_events_listsize, pending_events_top, add_pending_event)
(select_pending_event, send_pending_signals, wait_all_threads):
Deleted; we now use lwp-pool.c for all this.
(attach_thread, continue_thread, continue_all_threads)
(singlestep_thread, thread_db_singlestep_program)
(thread_db_continue_thread, thread_db_singlestep_thread): Use the
lwp-pool.c functions, instead of calling the lwp manipulation
functions directly and managing state here.  Keep track of the
focus thread.
(find_new_threads_callback): Always call attach_thread.  If we're
using libthread_db events, enable event reporting for the new
thread.
(update_thread_list): Take the current child process as an
argument; if the current focus thread disappears, clear the
process's focus_thread pointer.
(thread_db_thread_next): Pass the current child process to
update_thread_list.
(thread_db_thread_info): Reformat thread descriptions.  Mark
threads whose pid is equal to the process ID.
(thread_db_check_child_state): Use the lwp-pool functions, instead
of calling waitpid and the old stop-all-threads functions.  If we
have a focus thread, only check for a status on that thread.
Check for libthread_db events.  Use ignore_thread_signal, instead
of writing it out.
(thread_db_break_program): New function.
(thread_db_attach): Register it as the target's 'break_program'
method.  Always preload the symbol list with the names we'll need
for the signal-based interface, even if we have td_symbol_list.
Use lwp_pool_new_stopped to register the initial thread.  Clear
the focus thread.
* ptrace-target.c: #define _GNU_SOURCE and #include <sys/types.h>
and <linux/unistd.h>, to get declarations for the functions we
need.
#include "lwp-ctrl.h".
(continue_lwp, singlestep_lwp, attach_lwp): Remove
unnecessary 'extern' keywords.  Move pre-function comments to
lwp-ctrl.h.  Take an ordinary 'pid_t', not an 'lwpid_t', since
we're calling ptrace / tkill, and that's what they expect; rename
arguments accordingly.  Preserve value of errno across calls to
fprintf when reporting errors.
(kill_lwp): All the above, and use tkill system call if available.
* configure.in: Whenever we include thread-db.o in TARGET_MODULES,
also include lwp-pool.o.
On i386 and FRV Linux, use the stock-breakpoints module.
* config.in: Add template for STOCK_BREAKPOINTS.
* Makefile.am (EXTRA_rda_SOURCES): Include stock-breakpoints.c.
* Makefile.in, aclocal.m4, configure: Regenerated.

* thread-db.c: #include arch.h.
* linux-target.c: #include arch.h.
(allocate_empty_arch): New function.
(x86_make_arch): New function.
(MAKE_ARCH): New #definition.
(linux_attach): Initialize process's architecture.

Provide arch-independent framework for breakpoints.
* server.h (struct arch_bp_table): New forward struct declaration.
(struct child_process): New member: 'breakpoint_table'.
* linux-target.c (linux_attach): Initialize process's breakpoint
table, if the architecture defines a breakpoint table constructor.
* arch.h (struct arch): Add fields pointing to breakpoint functions.

Provide a module implementing breakpoints for architectures that
support a simple software breakpoint model ("patch these bytes
into the instruction stream").
* stock-breakpoints.h, stock-breakpoints.c: New files.
* linux-target.c: If STOCK_BREAKPOINTS is #defined, then #include
"stock-breakpoints.h".
* Makefile.am (EXTRA_rda_SOURCES): Add stock-breakpoints.c.
* Makefile.in: Updated.

Define x86 breakpoint functions using the stock-breakpoints.c
model.
* configure.in: When configuring for an x86 target, include
stock-breakpoints.o in the mix, and #define STOCK_BREAKPOINTS.
* configure: Regenerated.
* config.in (STOCK_BREAKPOINTS): Provide #definition template.
* linux-target.c (stock_table_to_x86, x86_table_to_stock,
stock_bp_to_x86, x86_bp_to_stock, x86_make_bp_table, x86_set_bp,
x86_delete_bp, x86_bp_hit_p): New functions.
(x86_make_arch): Register the latter four as our breakpoint
methods.

Use the libthread_db event interface to communicate with the
thread library, if the old signal-based interface is not
supported.
* thread-db.c: #include <assert.h>.
(thread_db_event_str): New function.
(get_target_int_by_name, set_target_int_by_name, get_thread_signals)
(cancel_signal, restart_signal, debug_signal): Move these to just
before thread_db_dlopen; get_thread_signals is a subroutine of that.
(using_thread_db_events, create_notification, death_notification,
create_event_breakpoint, death_event_breakpoint): New global vars.
(get_event_notification, set_event_breakpoint)
(insert_thread_db_event_breakpoints)
(delete_thread_db_event_breakpoints, request_thread_db_events)
(hit_thread_db_event_breakpoint): New functions.
(thread_db_open): Call get_thread_signals, and if that fails, call
request_thread_db_events.
(struct event_list): Add 'thread_db_event' member.
(add_pending_event): Initialize it.
(delete_pending_event, handle_thread_db_events): New functions.
(find_new_threads_callback): If we're using the event interface,
enable event reporting on each new thread we find.
(select_pending_event): Return a value to indicate whether we
selected any event at all.
(continue_all_threads): Send a restart signal only if we're using
the signal-based interface.
(thread_db_check_child_state): If we're using the libthread_db
event interface to communicate with the inferior thread library,
check for those events here.  If select_pending_event says it
didn't find anything interesting, that means we consumed all the
reportable events; continue the program silently.
* ptrace-target.c: #include <sys/types.h> and <linux/unistd.h>.
(tkill): Generate code for this syscall.
(stop_lwp): Use tkill instead of kill.

* thread-db.c (thread_db_check_child_state): Call stop_all_threads
before calling update_thread_list, so RDA will have to compete for
CPU with fewer running threads.

* thread-db.c (wait_all_threads): Move calls to
select_pending_event and send_pending_signals from here...
(thread_db_check_child_state): To here.

* thread-db.c (ignore_thread_signal): New function.
(thread_db_check_child_state): Call it, instead of writing it out.

* thread-db.c (thread_db_open): Return 0 on success, -1 on
failure, like most of the other int-valued functions in this file,
and like most system calls.

* thread-db.c (struct gdbserv_thread): Doc fixes.

* thread-db.c: #include "gdbserv-utils.h", to get prototypes for
the 'struct gdbserv_reg' manipulation functions.

* thread-db.c (thread_db_noisy): Initialize to 1.

* thread-db.c (thread_debug_name): New function.
(find_new_threads_callback): If noisy, report new threads.
(stop_thread): If noisy, report stopping threads.
(select_pending_event): If noisy, report what we selected.
(wait_all_threads): If noisy, report before each thread we wait
for.

* thread-db.c (stop_all_threads): Doc fixes.

* aclocal.m4: Regenerated.

@Separate management of kernel-level LWPs from that of libpthread /
libthread_db-level threads.
* lwp-pool.c, lwp-pool.h: New files.
* thread-db.c: #include "lwp-ctrl.h" and "lwp-pool.h".
(struct gdbserv_thread): Delete members 'attached', 'stopped',
'waited', and 'stepping'.  This structure is now just a
'td_thrinfo_t' and a list link.  Describe some quirks in the
meanings of certain 'ti' fields.
(thread_list_lookup_by_lid): Move later in file, so we can use
information directly from our proc handle.  Be skeptical of ZOMBIE
or UNKNOWN threads whose LWP ID is equal to the PID in the proc
handle.
(thread_debug_name): Move later in file, so we can use
thread_db_state_str.
(attach_thread): Use lwp pool functions to attach.  Attach to
zombies.  When using signal-based communication, send the thread
the restart signal immediately.
(find_new_threads_callback): Go ahead and attach to all threads.
The LWP pool functions tolerate attaching to a given LWP more than
once.
(update_thread_list): Take the process as an argument.  If the
focus thread has disappeared, set process->focus_thread to NULL.
(thread_db_thread_next): Pass the process to update_thread_list.
(stop_thread, stop_all_threads, add_pending_event,
delete_pending_event, select_pending_event, send_pending_signals,
wait_all_threads, continue_all_threads): Deleted.
(handle_thread_db_event): Renamed from handle_thread_db_events.
Take the process structure as an argument, and check only for a
thread-db event notification from process->event_thread.  Use LWP
pool functions.
(continue_thread, singlestep_thread): Use LWP pool functions.
(thread_db_continue_program, thread_db_singlestep_program,
thread_db_continue_thread, thread_db_singlestep_thread): Use LWP
pool functions, and update process->focus_thread appropriately.
(thread_db_check_child_state): Use the LWP pool functions.  Rather
than stopping all LWP's, choosing the most interesting events, and
then arranging to re-create all the other wait statuses we got,
just pick the first event we get from lwp_pool_waitpid (either on
the focus thread, if there is one, or on any thread) and report
that.  Use the new handle_thread_db_event function.
(struct event_list, pending_events, pending_events_listsize,
pending_events_top): Deleted; replaced by LWP pool code.
(thread_db_attach): Tell the LWP pool about the PID we're
attaching to.  Clear the focus thread.
* server.h (struct process): New member: 'focus_thread'.
* gdbserv-thread-db.h (continue_lwp, singlestep_lwp, attach_lwp,
stop_lwp): Move declarations from here...
* lwp-ctrl.h: ... to here.  New file.
(kill_lwp): Renamed from stop_lwp; allow caller to specify any
signal.
* ptrace-target.c: #include "lwp-ctrl.h".
(continue_lwp, singlestep_lwp, attach_lwp, stop_lwp): Move
function comments to lwp-ctrl.h, and expand.
* configure.in: Whenever we select 'thread-db.o', select
'lwp-pool.o' as well.
* configure: Regenerated.

* thread-db.c (thread_db_check_child_state): Remove extraneous
call to handle_waitstatus.  Remove extra check for exited main
thread.

* thread-db.c (thread_db_thread_info): List the type and state
before the PID, and mention whether the LWP's PID is equal to that
of the main thread, since ZOMBIE and UNKNOWN threads whose LWP's
PID is equal are probably actually exited threads.

* thread-db.c (add_thread_to_list): Zero out entire structure.

* thread-db.c (thread_db_state_str, thread_db_type_str): Remove
spaces from names; we don't always want them, and the caller can
use printf formatting directives to arrange things as they please.

* ptrace-target.c (continue_lwp, singlestep_lwp, attach_lwp,
stop_lwp): Change arguments from 'lwpid_t' to 'pid_t'.  lwpid_t is
strictly a thread-db type; these are functions that use system
calls, which all expect pid_t.  Rename arguments from 'lwpid' to
'pid'.

* ptrace-target.c: #define _GNU_SOURCE to get declaration for
strsignal.
(kill_lwp): Enhance error reporting.
