log
@Added files comprising RDA.
@
text
@This directory contains an implementation of a server for the gdb remote
protocol, built as a host library.  It is suitable for applications that
are to be remote targets of a debugger, such as simulators, interfaces to ICE
hardware, etc.

Roadmap:

	lib/		contains the remote protocol stub implementation
			is not meant to be installed
			builds into librda.a and librda.la
			includes headers

	samples/	contains a sample application of the library

Note: remember to use autoconf and automake to configure, unlike some of the other
tools.
