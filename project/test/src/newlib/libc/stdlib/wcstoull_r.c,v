        * libc/stdlib/wcstoull_r.c:  Add EINVAL return for bad base value,
        include wchar.h for prototype, remove extraneous includes, use
        C99/POSIX ULLONG_MAX (but allow for poor limits.h).
        * libc/stdlib/wcstoull.c:  Fix usage comments (mistakes and to add
        base value check noted above), remove extraneous includes.
        * libc/stdio/asnprintf.c:  Add #include "local.h" to get function
        prototype for _svfprintf_r().
        * libc/stdio/vasnprintf.c:  Ditto.
        * libc/stdio/local.h:  Add function prototype for __submore().
        * libc/include/stdio.h:  Add function prototypes for _fseeko_r and
        _ftello_r.
        * libc/posix/namespace.h:  Commented out define for write to
        eliminate write() prototype being missing for collate.c (which is
        the only file that presently includes namespace.h).
        * libc/include/reent.h:  Added _rename_r.
        * libc/reent/renamer.c:  Corrected function prototypes in synopses.
        * libc/locale/ldpart.c:  Use struct stat64 when calling fstat64.
