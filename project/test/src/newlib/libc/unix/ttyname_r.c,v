        * libc/unix/ttyname.c:  Remove ttyname_r() (to a new file to avoid
        coupling ttyname_r() and ttyname() due to the latter's large buffer).
        * libc/unix/ttyname_r.c:  New file to hold ttyname_r(), previously in
        ttyname.c.
        * libc/unix/ttyname.h:  New file (common size definition for the 2
        ttyname*c files that are now split).
        * libc/unix/Makefile.am (ELIX_2_SOURCES):  Add ttyname_r.c.
        * libc/unix/Makefile.in:  Regenerate.
