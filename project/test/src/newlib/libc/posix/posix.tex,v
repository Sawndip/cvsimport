log
@Improve popen compatibility with glibc.

* libc/posix/popen.c (popen): The 2006-08-22 change to use
FD_CLOEXEC disagrees with other implementations; instead, use
pidlist to work even when fcntl is not available.  Meanwhile,
support the 'e' modifier to set CLOEXEC, as in glibc.  Drop
cygwin-specific code, now that cygwin has its own version.
* libc/posix/Makefile.am (CHEWOUT_FILES): Document popen.
* libc/posix/posix.tex: New file.

not by C.  Each function documents which header to use.
