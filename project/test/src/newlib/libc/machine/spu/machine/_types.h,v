        * libc/include/sys/types.h: Use __dev_t, __uid_t, and __gid_t to
        typedef dev_t, gid_t, and uid_t.
        * libc/include/sys/_types.h: Move previous dev_t, uid_t and gid_t
        types.h code to here, but typedef __dev_t, __uid_t, and __gid_t instead.
        Change to lower case for all __foo_t_defined names.
        * libc/machine/spu/machine/_types.h: Add SPU specific __dev_t,
        __uid_t, and __gid_t making them all four bytes. Change to lower case
        for all __foo_t_defined names.
