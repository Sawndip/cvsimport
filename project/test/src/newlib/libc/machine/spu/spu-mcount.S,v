/* _mcount extracts the address of the function just entered and the address
    of the caller of that function and then calls __mcount_internal. The
    prologue calls mcount without saving any registers. The return address is
    stored in $75. The _mcount function has to:
     - create a new stack frame
     - save registers $2 to $75 on the stack
     - copy the two addresses ($0 and $75) into the argument registers $3 and $4
     - call __mcount_internal
     - restore registers
     - return to $75  */

   saving and restoring the register.

   saveregs     first, last    Saves registers from first to the last.
   restoreregs  first, last    Restores registers from last down to first.
