FUNCTION
<<__fsetlocking>>---set or query locking mode on FILE stream

INDEX
	__fsetlocking

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdio_ext.h>
	int __fsetlocking(FILE *<[fp]>, int <[type]>);

DESCRIPTION
This function sets how the stdio functions handle locking of FILE <[fp]>.
The following values describe <[type]>:

<<FSETLOCKING_INTERNAL>> is the default state, where stdio functions
automatically lock and unlock the stream.

<<FSETLOCKING_BYCALLER>> means that automatic locking in stdio functions
is disabled. Applications which set this take all responsibility for file
locking themselves.

<<FSETLOCKING_QUERY>> returns the current locking mode without changing it.

RETURNS
<<__fsetlocking>> returns the current locking mode of <[fp]>.

PORTABILITY
This function originates from Solaris and is also provided by GNU libc.

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
