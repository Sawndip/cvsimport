FUNCTION
<<fmemopen>>---open a stream around a fixed-length string

INDEX
	fmemopen

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
	#include <stdio.h>
	FILE *fmemopen(void *restrict <[buf]>, size_t <[size]>,
		       const char *restrict <[mode]>);

DESCRIPTION
<<fmemopen>> creates a seekable <<FILE>> stream that wraps a
fixed-length buffer of <[size]> bytes starting at <[buf]>.  The stream
is opened with <[mode]> treated as in <<fopen>>, where append mode
starts writing at the first NUL byte.  If <[buf]> is NULL, then
<[size]> bytes are automatically provided as if by <<malloc>>, with
the initial size of 0, and <[mode]> must contain <<+>> so that data
can be read after it is written.

The stream maintains a current position, which moves according to
bytes read or written, and which can be one past the end of the array.
The stream also maintains a current file size, which is never greater
than <[size]>.  If <[mode]> starts with <<r>>, the position starts at
<<0>>, and file size starts at <[size]> if <[buf]> was provided.  If
<[mode]> starts with <<w>>, the position and file size start at <<0>>,
and if <[buf]> was provided, the first byte is set to NUL.  If
<[mode]> starts with <<a>>, the position and file size start at the
location of the first NUL byte, or else <[size]> if <[buf]> was
provided.

When reading, NUL bytes have no significance, and reads cannot exceed
the current file size.  When writing, the file size can increase up to
<[size]> as needed, and NUL bytes may be embedded in the stream (see
<<open_memstream>> for an alternative that automatically enlarges the
buffer).  When the stream is flushed or closed after a write that
changed the file size, a NUL byte is written at the current position
if there is still room; if the stream is not also open for reading, a
NUL byte is additionally written at the last byte of <[buf]> when the
stream has exceeded <[size]>, so that a write-only <[buf]> is always
NUL-terminated when the stream is flushed or closed (and the initial
<[size]> should take this into account).  It is not possible to seek
outside the bounds of <[size]>.  A NUL byte written during a flush is
restored to its previous value when seeking elsewhere in the string.

RETURNS
The return value is an open FILE pointer on success.  On error,
<<NULL>> is returned, and <<errno>> will be set to EINVAL if <[size]>
is zero or <[mode]> is invalid, ENOMEM if <[buf]> was NULL and memory
could not be allocated, or EMFILE if too many streams are already
open.

PORTABILITY
This function is being added to POSIX 200x, but is not in POSIX 2001.

Supporting OS subroutines required: <<sbrk>>.
