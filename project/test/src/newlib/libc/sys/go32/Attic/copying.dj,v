   Copyright Information for sources and executables that are marked
   Copyright (C) DJ Delorie

This document is Copyright (C) DJ Delorie and may be distributed
verbatim, but changing it is not allowed.

Source code copyright DJ Delorie is distributed under the terms of the
GNU General Public Licence, with the following exceptions:


* Source code copyright DJ Delorie is distributed under the terms of the
  GNU General Public Licence, with the following exceptions:
  ("go32.exe" refers to go32.exe and debug32.exe)

  * There are no conditions on distributing copies of stub.exe as
    it is originally distributed in this software package, prepended
    onto a binary or otherwise.  This is the recommended distribution
    mechanism for applications.
  
  * Binaries of emu387 may be distributed with no restrictions.

  * If a user creates an application, prepends a copy of go32.exe onto
    the beginning of it, and distributes it free of charge, then the
    user is under no obligations to distribute source or pay royalties.
    Note that the copyright terms of the FSF and/or UCB must be
    obeyed regardless of this.
  
  * If a user creates an application, prepends a copy of go32.exe onto
    the beginning of it, and charges a fee for the software, then a
    royalty of $5 or 5% of the selling price per copy sold must be paid
    to DJ Delorie.  DJ's mailing address is documented on the web page:
    http://www.delorie.com/users/dj/.  Note that shareware programs are 
    not considered "sold" until payment is rendered for them.

  * For all other cases, source code for go32.exe must be distributed
    with any distributed copies of go32.exe.
  
  * Software that requires go32.exe to run, but is not distributed with
    a copy of go32.exe, incurs no obligations with regards to the
    above sections.

  * Contact me for special terms if none of the above are suitable.

  * Donations are always appreciated.

  The intent of this copyright is this: If you make money by using the
  programs I wrote, I get some of it.  If you use your sources to
  teach others how to write programs, I'll support you.

Changes to source code copyright BSD or FSF are copyright DJ Delorie, but
fall under the terms of the original copyright.
