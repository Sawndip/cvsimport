        * Merge RTEMS specific .h files into main libc/include.
        * libc/sys/rtems/include/signal.h: Removed.
        * libc/sys/rtems/include/time.h: Removed.
        * libc/sys/rtems/sys/features.h: Removed.
        * libc/sys/rtems/sys/sched.h: Removed.
        * libc/sys/rtems/sys/siginfo.h: Removed.
        * libc/sys/rtems/sys/signal.h: Removed.
        * libc/sys/rtems/sys/time.h: Removed.
        * libc/sys/rtems/sys/times.h: Removed.
        definitions for time_t and clock_t since these are
        no longer in time.h.
        * libc/include/pthread.h: New file.
        * libc/include/sys/sched.h: New file.
        * libc/include/sys/features.h: New file.
        * libc/include/time.h: Removed duplicate definition of clock_t
        and time_t, get them from <sys/types.h> instead.  Add prototypes        for POSIX clock and timer functionality.
        * libc/sys/linux/sys/types.h: Changed to include
        * libc/include/machine/types.h: Add _CLOCKID_T_ and _TIMER_T_.
        * libc/include/sys/signal.h: Add more complete set of POSIX
        signal functionality including real-time and threaded signals.
        * libc/include/sys/types.h: Add clock_t, time_t, struct
        timespec, and struct itimerspec.  Centralizing these makes
        things cleaner.  RTEMS uses 64-bit dev_t.
        Added numerous primitive definitions
        for pthreads including macros, pthread_attr_t,
        pthread_mutexattr_t, pthread_condattr_t, pthread_key_t,
        pthread_once_t, and pthread_t.
        * libc/include/sys/unistd.h: Added getlogin_r() prototype.
        If RTEMS follow POSIX on read(), write() and sbrk() prototype.
        Feature flags removed and moved to new file <sys/features.h>.
        Full set of POSIX sysconf() constants
