        * configure.in: Comment out the --enable-newlib-fp-hw option
        as the mathfp library is inaccurate and should not be used.
        * Makefile.am: Add comment regarding the mathfp directory.
        * configure: Regenerated.
        * Makefile.in: Ditto.
        * libm/mathfp/README: New file that details why the mathfp
        directory is not used.

@This directory was an experiment to use floating-point operations to implement
the math library when a processor had a floating-point instruction set.  The
experiment was a failure in that some of the algorithms chosen (e.g. recursive
algorithms for sin/cos, etc..) are too simple and do not provide proper accuracy 
nor handle very large or very small inputs adequately.

The code is considered moth-balled.  The stable math library routines can be
found in libm/math and the configuration option to use this has been removed.

If you wish to experiment with the concept, please feel free and report back if
you have major improvements.
