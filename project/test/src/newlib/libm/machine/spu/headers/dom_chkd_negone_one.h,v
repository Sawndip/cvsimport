 *
 * We *only* set errno, and do not bother setting the actual return value
 * of any functions to a NAN. That way, we have the same method for double
 * and single precision (there are no float nans for single precision so
 * those can't return a nan).

 * Note that for newlib, errno is/was a function call, so not so obviously
 * we are not branchless here. Unknown if adding a branch (and avoiding a
 * call to __errno) is faster than this current code.
