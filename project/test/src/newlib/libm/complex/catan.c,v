DESCRIPTION

        imaginary axis.

        <<catanf>> is identical to <<catan>>, except that it performs
        its calculations on <<floats complex>>.

RETURNS
        @@ifnottex
        These functions return the complex arc tangent value, in the range
        of a strip mathematically  unbounded  along the imaginary axis
        and in the interval [-pi/2, +pi/2] along the real axis.
