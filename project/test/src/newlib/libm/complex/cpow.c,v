DESCRIPTION
        @@ifnottex
        The cpow functions compute the complex power function x^y

        The cpow functions compute the complex power function $x^y$

        <<cpowf>> is identical to <<cpow>>, except that it performs
        its calculations on <<floats complex>>.

RETURNS
        The cpow functions return the complex power function value.

PORTABILITY
        <<cpow>> and <<cpowf>> are ISO C99

QUICKREF
        <<cpow>> and <<cpowf>> are ISO C99
