FUNCTION
        <<cacosh>>, <<cacoshf>>---complex arc hyperbolic cosine

INDEX
        cacosh
INDEX
        cacoshf

ANSI_SYNOPSIS
       #include <complex.h>
       double complex cacosh(double complex <[z]>);
       float complex cacoshf(float complex <[z]>);


DESCRIPTION
        These functions compute the complex arc hyperbolic cosine of <[z]>,
        with a branch cut at values less than 1 along the real axis.

        <<cacoshf>> is identical to <<cacosh>>, except that it performs
        its calculations on <<floats complex>>.

RETURNS
        @@ifnottex
        These functions return the complex arc hyperbolic cosine value, 
        in the range of a half-strip of non-negative values along the 
        real axis and in the interval [-i * pi, +i * pi] along the 
        imaginary axis.
