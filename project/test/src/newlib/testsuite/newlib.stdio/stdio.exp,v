        * libc/stdio/vfwprintf.c (wcvt): Add a new parameter len of type
        int.  *length is set to the value of (rev - digits) regardless
        of whether _MB_CAPABLE is defined or not.  Replace BUF with len
        in calling _mbsnrtowcs_r and also in the loop where _MB_CAPABLE
        is not defined.
        (_VFWPRINTF_R): Call wcvt with an extra argument.  Call wcvt
        again with allocated new buffer if buf is not large enough for
        the conversion.
        * testsuite/newlib.stdio/stdio.exp: New.
        * testsuite/newlib.stdio/swprintf.c: Likewise.
