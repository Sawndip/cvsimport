@- should have an intelligent way of mapping color use to color name
  likewise fonts

- ulset.tcl is not very easy to use
  should write class to manage menubar
  this could integrate ulset functionality and also balloon help
  should look at iwidgets 2.2 again to make sure we
  aren't gratuitously incompatible

- add more bitmaps/gifs from S-N

- use a real gettext, not the dummy one we have now
  see if it is possible to use some of the gnu code, for instance
  xgettext.
  the runtime code must be written by us; probably just use db

- rewrite the canvas patches as a pure extension
  the current situation is terrible
  later, use a different layout algorithm.  ISI sucks.
  See:
	A Technique for Drawing Directed Graphs
	Emden R Gansner, Eleftherios Koutsofios, Stephen C. North, and
		Kiem-Phong Vo
	IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering Vol 19, No 3

- must have sensible way to track toplevel state and save in database

- a way to make optionmenus which are statically sized to the
  correct width
