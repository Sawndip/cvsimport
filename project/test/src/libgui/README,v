@libgui - Handy GUI code

This module has various pieces of code that are useful for a GUI.  For
the most part, they are Tcl/Tk-related.

Open issues:
- bitmaps and canvas code are duplicated in S-N; should look into
  sharing
- tkTreeTable taken from S-N but modified; should use the same
  version in both places.  Better yet, replace this widget with
  one that works better

Here's a brief runthrough:

library/
  Directory of Tcl code

  balloon.tcl
    Tcl code to implement balloon help (aka tooltips)

    Primary interface is the "balloon" command.  See last function in
    file for details on usage

  bindings.tcl
    Provides bind_widget_after_class proc; rearranges bindtags in
    a frequently-useful way.

  canvas.tcl
    Tcl procs relating to canvas widgets

    set_scroll_region canvas
      Set the scroll region on CANVAS to include all items in the
      canvas.  Most easily used when bound to <Configure> on the
      canvas.

  def.tcl
      Defining words.

      defarray name ?value?
        Define a global array named NAME.  VALUE, if present, is the
        initial value.  VALUE is in the format expected by "array
        set".

      defvar name ?value?
        Define a new global variable named NAME.

  gensym.tcl
      Provides the proc "gensym", which generates new symbol names.

  gettext.tcl
      Defines the stub proc "gettext", used for looking up text in a
      localization database.

  hooks.tcl
      Provides procs for handling hooks (lists of functions that
      should be run when something happens).

  lframe.tcl
      Provides the Labelledframe widget -- a frame with a groove and
      a label.

  list.tcl
      Defines useful list procs.  Some of these are Tcl versions of C
      functions in TclX.

      lvarpush listvar element ?index?
        Insert ELEMENT into list stored in LISTVAR (a variable).
        Element is inserted at INDEXth position.  INDEX defaults to
        0.

      lvarpop listvar ?index?
        Remove INDEXth element from list stored in LISTVAR (a
        variable).  Returns the removed element.  INDEX defaults to
        0.

      lassign list args
        Assign successive elements from LIST to variables named in
        ARGS.  If LIST is longer than ARGS, assign a list of remaining
        elements to last variable.

      lrmdups list args
        Remove duplicates and sort list.  ARGS, if specified, are
        arguments to lsort

      lremove list element
        Return list created by removing the first item `ELEMENT'

  mono.tcl
    Procs for handling monochrome displays or colorblind users

  prefs.tcl
    Application preference code.  This will probably vanish at some
    point, once we figure out how we really want to do this.  I just
    had this code lying around, and it was useful to me, so I included
    it.

    Defines a single interface, "preference", which has several
    subcommands:

	preference define name default docstring ?handler?
	  Define a new preference.  HANDLER, if specified, is a proc
	  to run whenever the preference's value changes.

	preference get name
	  Return value of preference.

	preference documentation name
	  Return doc string of preference

	preference varname name
	  Return name of variable representing named preference.  This
	  can be used eg as the -variable of a radiobutton.

	preference set name value
	  Set preference.

	preference get_commands
	  Return text of commands which, when evalled, will restore
	  the current state of all defined preferences.

  sendpr.tcl
    The sendpr widget; a GUI for send-pr.

  topbind.tcl
    Code for bindings on toplevels.

    bind_for_toplevel_only toplevel sequence script
      Put a binding on window TOPLEVEL for event SEQUENCE.  When the
      event is seen, SCRIPT will run.  This proc adds a new bindtag
      to the toplevel to avoid the problems associated with putting
      bindings directly on toplevels.

  ulset.tcl
    Attempt to make setting the -underline option easier.  This is
    particular good when using gettext.  Unfortunately the interface
    is hard to use; it should be changed.

    extract_label_info option label
      Extract underline and label info from descriptor string LABEL.
      Any underline in LABEL is extracted, and the next character's
      index is used as the -underline value.  There must be only one
      underline in LABEL.  This proc returns a list of the form:

	 OPTION NEWLABEL -underline INDEX

      Eg:  extract_label_info -text _File
	-> {-text File -underline 0}

src/
  Directory of C code.  This is all put into libide.a.

  paths.c
    Useful startup code that all applications should run.

    int ide_initialize (Tcl_Interp *interp, char *appname);

    This function:
    - Sets the global Tcl variable ide_application_name to APPNAME.
    - Searches the filesystem for the libide Tcl code, and sets
      up the auto_path appropriately.  The IDE_LIBRARY environment
      variable can override the searching.
    - Sets up the auto_path to include the application's Tcl library
      as well (if possible).  Applications should install their Tcl
      code in $(datadir)/APPNAME/
    - Runs the application's startup file - $(datadir)/APPNAME/APPNAME.tcl
    - Sets these entries in the global array Paths:
        Paths(bitmapdir)  Location of libide bitmaps
        Paths(appdir)     Location of application's scripts

    This function returns TCL_OK on success, and something else on
    error.

  subcommand.c
    Makes it easy to write commands which are split into a number of
    subcommands (eg, like the Tcl "file" command).

    int create_command_with_subcommands (Tcl_interp *interp, char *name,
                                         struct subcommand_table *table)

    Create a new Tcl command name NAME.  TABLE describes the
    subcommands; see subcommand.h for details.  Returns TCL_OK on
    success, TCL_ERROR on failure.

  tkCanvEdge.c, tkCanvLayout.c, tkCanvLayout.h, tkCanvas.c, tkCanvas.h
    Patched versions (ugh) of the corresponding Tk files, and some new
    files.  These files implement graph layout for canvases.

  treetable.tcl
    Code that is useful when using the treetable widget.
    Applications should run "multix_treetable_bindings TreeTable"
    at startup.

a186 11

  tkTreeTable.c tkTreeTable.c
    The treetable widget.  This is essentially a hierarchical listbox
    widget.  As far as I know, there is no documentation.  At some
    point, maybe I'll write some up.  This widget came from S-N (but
    they got it from somewhere else), but I've changed it somewhat.

    We'll be merging our version with S-N at some point.

    Your package should run create_treetable_command to make the
    treetable widget.  Only do this after running Tk_Init.
