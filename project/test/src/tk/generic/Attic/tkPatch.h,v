@/*
 * tkPatch.h --
 *
 * This file does nothing except define a "patch level" for Tk.
 * The patch level has the form "X.YpZ" where X.Y is the base
 * release, and Z is a serial number that is used to sequence
 * patches for a given release.  Thus 4.0p1 is the first patch
 * to release 4.0, 4.0p2 is the patch that follows 4.0p1, and
 * so on.  The "pZ" is omitted in an original new release, and
 * it is replaced with "bZ" for beta releases or "aZ" for alpha
 * releases (e.g. 4.0b1 is the first beta release of Tk 4.0).
 * The patch level ensures that patches are applied in the
 * correct order and only to appropriate sources.
