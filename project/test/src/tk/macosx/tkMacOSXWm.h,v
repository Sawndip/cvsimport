 * WM_NEGATIVE_X -		non-zero means x-coordinate is measured in

 * WM_NEGATIVE_Y -		non-zero means y-coordinate is measured in

 * WM_SYNC_PENDING -		set to non-zero while waiting for the window

 * WM_VROOT_OFFSET_STALE -	non-zero means that (x,y) offset information

 *				specified, so we added it implicitly at
 *				the end of the list.
 * WM_WIDTH_NOT_RESIZABLE -	non-zero means that we're not supposed to

 *				window (controlled by "wm resizable"
 *				command).
 * WM_HEIGHT_NOT_RESIZABLE -	non-zero means that we're not supposed to
