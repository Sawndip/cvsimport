@This is a terse description of the new features added to readline-6.2 since
the release of readline-6.1.

a.  The history library does not try to write the history filename in the
    current directory if $HOME is unset.  This closes a potential security
    problem if the application does not specify a history filename.

b.  New bindable variable `completion-display-width' to set the number of
    columns used when displaying completions.

c.  New bindable variable `completion-case-map' to cause case-insensitive
    completion to treat `-' and `_' as identical.

d.  There are new bindable vi-mode command names to avoid readline's case-
    insensitive matching not allowing them to be bound separately.

e.  New bindable variable `menu-complete-display-prefix' causes the menu
    completion code to display the common prefix of the possible completions
    before cycling through the list, instead of after.

This is a terse description of the new features added to readline-5.1 since
the release of readline-5.0.
d4 3
a6 1
1.  New Features in Readline
d8 2
a9 2
a.  The key sequence sent by the keypad `delete' key is now automatically   
    bound to delete-char.
d11 2
a12 2
b.  A negative argument to menu-complete now cycles backward through the
    completion list.
d14 2
a15 3
c.  A new bindable readline variable:  bind-tty-special-chars.  If non-zero,
    readline will bind the terminal special characters to their readline
    equivalents when it's called (on by default).
d17 3
a19 17
d.  New bindable command: vi-rubout.  Saves deleted text for possible  
    reinsertion, as with any vi-mode `text modification' command; `X' is bound
    to this in vi command mode.

e.  If the rl_completion_query_items is set to a value < 0, readline never
    asks the user whether or not to view the possible completions.

f.  New application-callable auxiliary function, rl_variable_value, returns
    a string corresponding to a readline variable's value.

g.  When parsing inputrc files and variable binding commands, the parser
    strips trailing whitespace from values assigned to boolean variables
    before checking them.

h.  A new external application-controllable variable that allows the LINES
    and COLUMNS environment variables to set the window size regardless of
    what the kernel returns.
