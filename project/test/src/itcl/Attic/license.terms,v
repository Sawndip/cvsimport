@        Import of Itcl 3.3.
        * itcl/configure.in, itk/configure.in, iwidgets/configure.in:
        Replace with configure.ac.
        * itcl/configure, itk/configure, iwidgets/configure: Regenerate.
        * configure.ac, Makefile.am, Makefile.in: New files.
        * README: "New" file.
        * aclocal.m4: Regenerate.
        * itcl/Makefile.in (RANLIB): Replace with RANLIB_LIB so
        that the toplevel build does not override this variable.
        * itk/Makefile.in (RANLIB): Likewise.
        * itcl/tclconfig/tcl.m4 (TEA_PATH_TCLCONFIG): Look for itclConfig.sh
        in the platform-specific location (unix or win).
        (TEA_PATH_TKCONFIG): Likewise.
        (TEA_MAKE_LIB): Even on windows, GCC libraries must start with "lib".
        * itk/tclconfig.m4: Copy of itcl/tcl.m4.
        * iwidgets/tcl.m4: Remove.
        * iwidgets/tclconfig: New directory.
        * iwidgets/tclconfig/tcl.m4, iwidgets/tclconfig/install-sh: Copies
        of itcl/tclconfig files.
        * iwidgets/Makefile.in (MKINSTALLDIRS): Use mkdir -p.
        * iwidgets/configure.ac (PACKAGE): Rename to PACKAGE_NAME.
        Call TEA_INIT, add AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR and AC_PROG_INSTALL.
        Use TEA_* instead of SC_* macros.
        Search a few more directories for the itcl and itk libraries.
