@==========================================================================
 ------------------ [incr Widgets] Incoming Widgets ---------------------
==========================================================================

  This directory contains mega-widgets which should be considered beta.
We're looking for positive or negative feedback concerning their usefullness.
Should enough of a positive response be felt, then the widget will be
included in the [incr Widgets] distribution.  Otherwise, they will find
themseleves in the outgoing directory and later in /dev/null.  Please see
the source code to respond to the author of any mega-widgets found here.

  To place your "vote" for any new widget, please contact any [incr Widgets]
administrator.


Layout of the iwidgets4.0.1/incoming directory:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  src:   contains the source code for the new widgets
  demos: contains scripts you can source to see the widgets in action
  doc:   man pages (Note that a man page may not exist if the author did
         not submit one)



NEW WIDGETS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
collapsablewidget: Contributed by Vince Darley
buttoncage:        Contributed by Mark Alston



PROPOSED WIDGETS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following are proposed widgets as listed on SourceForge.  If anyone
has a desire to create one or more of these widgets, have at it!

o - How about adding an optionbox widget for organizing optionmenus. This
    widget would be analogous to the checkbox and radiobox widgets.
    (SF ticket #471529)

o - Could it be possible to enhance Scrolledhtml into a browser using the
    http package included with the tcl core?  (SF ticket #426759)  (Note
    from Chad - very cool idea - anyone interested in working on this?
    Check out the SF ticket for some pointers.)
