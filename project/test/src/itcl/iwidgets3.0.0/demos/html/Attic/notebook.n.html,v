See the <A HREF="http://www.sco.com/Technology/tcl/man/tk_man/options.n.html"> "options" </A> manual entry for details on the standard options.
</pre><H2>WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS</H2>
<P>
<pre>
Name:                   <B>auto</B>
Class:                  <B>Auto</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-auto</B>
</pre>
<UL>
Specifies whether to use the automatic packing/unpacking algorithm of the
notebook. A value of <B>true</B> indicates that page frames will be unpacked 
and packed acoording to the algorithm described in the <B>select</B> command. 
A value of <B>false</B> leaves the current page packed and subsequent selects, 
next, or previous commands do not switch pages automatically. In either 
case the page's associated command (see the <B>add</B> command's description 
of the <B>command</B> option) is invoked. The value may have any of the 
forms accepted by the <B>Tcl_GetBoolean</B>, such as true, false, 0, 1, yes, 
or no.
</UL>
<UL>
For example, if a series of pages in a notebook simply change certain display
configurations of a graphical display, the <B>-auto</B> flag could be used. 
By setting it, the <B>-command</B> procs could do the appropriate reconfiguring
of the page when the page is switched.
</UL>
</pre><HR>
</pre><H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P>
The <B>notebook</B> command creates a new window (given by the pathName 
argument) and makes it into a notebook widget. Additional options, described 
above may be specified on the command line or in the option database to 
configure aspects of the notebook such as its colors, font, and text. 
The <B>notebook</B> command returns its <I>pathName</I> argument. At the time 
this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named pathName, but 
pathName's parent must exist.

A notebook is a widget that contains a set of pages. It displays one page from 
the set as the selected page. When a page is selected, the page's contents are 
displayed in the page area. When first created a notebook has no pages. Pages 
may be added or deleted using widget commands described below.

</pre><H2>NOTEBOOK PAGES</H2>
<P>
A notebook's pages area contains a single child site <B>frame</B>. When a new 
page is created it is a child of this frame. The page's child site frame 
serves as a geometry container for applications to pack widgets into. It is 
this frame that is automatically unpacked or packed when the <B>auto</B> 
option is <B>true</B>. This creates the effect of one page being visible at 
a time. When a new page is selected, the previously selected page's child 
site frame is automatically unpacked from the notebook's child site frame 
and the newly selected page's child site is packed into the notebook's 
child site frame.

However, sometimes it is desirable to handle page changes in a different 
manner. By specifying the <B>auto</B> option as <B>false</B>, child site 
packing can be disabled and done differently. For example, all widgets might 
be packed into the first page's child site frame. Then when a new page is 
selected, the application can reconfigure the widgets and give the appearance
that the page was flipped.

In both cases the <B>command</B> option for a page specifies a Tcl Command to
execute when the page is selected. In the case of <B>auto</B> being <B>true</B>, 
it is called between the unpacking of the previously selected page and the 
packing of the newly selected page.

</pre><H2>WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS</H2>
<P>
The <B>notebookfR command creates a new Tcl command whose name 
is <I>pathName</I>. This command may be used to invoke various operations 
on the widget. It has the following general form:
<pre>
<I>pathName option </I>?<I>arg arg ...</I>?
</pre>
<I>option</I> and the <I>arg</I>s
determine the exact behavior of the command.
<P>
Many of the widget commands for a notebook take as one argument an indicator 
of which page of the notebook to operate on. These indicators are called 
indexes and may be specified in any of the following forms:
<DL>
<DT> <I>number</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies the index of the the component. For menus, 0 corresponds to the 
left-most menu of the menu bar. For entries, 0 corresponds to the top-most 
entry of the menu.
<I>number</I>
Specifies the page numerically, where 0 corresponds to the first page in 
the notebook, 1 to the second, and so on.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>select</B>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies the currently selected page's index. If no page is currently 
selected, the value -1 is returned.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>end</B>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifes the last page in the notebooks's index. If the notebook is empty 
this will return -1.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pattern</I>
</I></B>
<DD> If the index doesn't satisfy the form of a number, then this form is used. 
Pattern is pattern-matched against the <B>label</B> of each page in the 
notebook, in order from the first to the last page, until a matching entry 
is found. The rules of <B>Tcl_StringMatch</B> are used.
</DL>
<P>
'.............................................................................
The following commands are possible for notebook widgets:
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>add</B> ?<I>option value</I>?
</I></B>
<DD> Add a new page at the end of the notebook. A new child site frame is 
created. Returns the child site pathName. If additional arguments are 
present, they specify any of the following options:
</DL>
<UL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-background</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a background color to use for displaying the child site frame 
of this page. If this option is specified as an empty string (the default), 
then the background option for the overall notebook is used.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-command</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a Tcl command to be executed when this page is selected. This 
allows the programmer a hook to reconfigure this page's widgets or any other
page's widgets.
<UL>
If the notebook has the auto option set to true, when a page is selected 
this command will be called immediately after the previously selected page 
is unpacked and immediately before this page is selected. The index value 
select is valid during this Tcl command. `index select' will return this 
page's page number. 
</UL>
<UL>
If the auto option is set to false, when a page is selected the unpack and 
pack calls are bypassed. This Tcl command is still called.
</UL>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-foreground</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying tab labels when tabs are 
in their normal unselected state. If this option is specified as an empty 
string (the default), then the foreground option for the overall notebook 
is used. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-label</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a string to associate with this page. This label serves as an 
additional identifier used to reference the page. This label may be used 
for the index value in widget commands. 
</DL>
</UL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>childSite</B> ?<I>index</I>?
</I></B>
<DD> If passed no arguments, returns a list of pathNames for all the pages in 
the notebook. If the notebook is empty, an empty list is returned
<UL>
If index is passed, it returns the pathName for the page's child site 
frame specified by index. Widgets that are created with this pathName will 
be displayed when the associated page is selected. If index is not a valid 
index, an empty string is returned. 
</UL>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>cget</B> <I>option</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <I>option</I>.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>configure</B> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> ...?
</I></B>
<DD> Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no <I>option</I> 
is specified, returns a list describing all of the available options 
for <I>pathName</I> (see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for information on the 
format of this list). If <I>option</I> is specified with no <I>value</I>, 
then the command returns a list describing the one named option (this 
list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned 
if no option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are specified, 
then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given 
value(s); in this case the command returns an empty string. <I>Option</I> 
may have any of the values accepted by the <B>notebook</B> command.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>delete</B> <I>index1</I> ?i</B></I>ndex2?
</I></B>
<DD> Delete all of the pages between <I>index1</I> and <I>index2</I> inclusive. 
If <I>index2</I> is omitted then it defaults to <I>index1</I>. Returns an 
empty string.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>index</B> <I>index</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Returns the numerical index corresponding to <I>index</I>.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>pathName</B> <B>insert</B> <I>index</I> ?<I>option</I> <I>value</I>?
</I></B>
<DD> Insert a new page in the notebook before the page specified by <I>index</I>. 
A new child site <B>frame</B> is created. See the <B>add</B> command for 
valid options. Returns the child site pathName.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>next</B>
</I></B>
<DD> Advances the selected page to the next page (order is determined by insertion 
order). If the currently selected page is the last page in the notebook, 
the selection wraps around to the first page in the notebook. 
<UL>
For notebooks with auto set to true the current page's child site is 
unpacked from the notebook's child site frame. Then the next page's child 
site is packed into the notebooks child site frame. The Tcl command given 
with the command option will be invoked between these two operations.
</UL>
<UL>
For notebooks with auto set to false the Tcl command given with the 
command option will be invoked.
</UL>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>pagecget</B> <I>index</I> ?<I>option</I>?
</I></B>
<DD> Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <I>option</I> 
for the page specified by <I>index</I>. The valid available options are the 
same as available to the <B>add</B> command.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>pageconfigure</B> <I>index</I> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> ...?
</I></B>
<DD> This command is similar to the configure command, except that it applies to 
the options for an individual page, whereas configure applies to the options 
for the notebook. Options may have any of the values accepted by the add 
widget command. If options are specified, options are modified as indicated 
in the command and the command returns an empty string. If no options are 
specified, returns a list describing the current options for 
page <I>index</I> (see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for information on the 
format of this list).
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>prev</B>
</I></B>
<DD> Moves the selected page to the previous page (order is determined by 
insertion order). If the currently selected page is the first page in the 
notebook, the selection wraps around to the last page in the notebook.
<UL>
For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>true</B> the current page's child 
site is unpacked from the notebook's child site frame. Then the previous 
page's child site is packed into the notebooks child site frame. The Tcl 
command given with the command option will be invoked between these two 
operations.
</UL>
<UL>
For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>false</B> the Tcl command given with 
the command option will be invoked.
</UL>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>select</B> <I>index</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Selects the page specified by <I>index</I> as the currently selected page.
<UL>
For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>true</B> the current page's child 
site is unpacked from the notebook's child site frame. Then the index page's 
child site is packed into the notebooks child site frame. The Tcl command 
given with the command option will be invoked between these two operations.
</UL>
<UL>
For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>false</B> the Tcl command given with 
the command option will be invoked.
</UL>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>view</B>
</I></B>
<DD> Returns the currently selected page. This command is for compatibility 
with the scrollbar widget.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>view</B> <I>index</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Selects the page specified by <I>index</I> as the currently selected page. 
This command is for compatibility with the scrollbar widget.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>view</B> <I>moveto</I> <I>fraction</I>

     command  line or in the option database to configure aspects
     of the notebook such as its  colors,  font,  and  text.  The
     <STRONG>notebook</STRONG>  command returns its <EM>pathName</EM> argument. At the time
     this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named
     pathName, but pathName's parent must exist.
     A notebook is a widget that contains  a  set  of  pages.  It
     displays  one page from the set as the selected page. When a
     page is selected, the page's contents are displayed  in  the
     page area. When first created a notebook has no pages. Pages
     may be added or  deleted  using  widget  commands  described
     below.



</PRE>
<H2>NOTEBOOK PAGES</H2><PRE>
     A notebook's pages area contains a single child site  <STRONG>frame</STRONG>.
     When  a new page is created it is a child of this frame. The
     page's child site frame serves as a geometry  container  for
     applications  to pack widgets into. It is this frame that is
     automatically unpacked or packed when  the  <STRONG>auto</STRONG>  option  is
     <STRONG>true</STRONG>. This creates the effect of one page being visible at a
     time. When a new page is selected, the  previously  selected
     page's  child  site frame is automatically unpacked from the
     notebook's child site frame and the  newly  selected  page's
     child site is packed into the notebook's child site frame.

     However, sometimes it is desirable to handle page changes in
     a  different manner. By specifying the <STRONG>auto</STRONG> option as <STRONG>false</STRONG>,
     child site packing can be disabled and done differently. For
     example,  all  widgets might be packed into the first page's
     child site frame. Then when a  new  page  is  selected,  the
     application can reconfigure the widgets and give the appear-
     ance that the page was flipped.

     In both cases the <STRONG>command</STRONG> option for a page specifies a  Tcl
     Command to execute when the page is selected. In the case of
     <STRONG>auto</STRONG> being <STRONG>true</STRONG>, it is called between the unpacking  of  the
     previously  selected  page  and  the  packing  of  the newly
     selected page.



</PRE>
<H2>WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS</H2><PRE>
     The <STRONG>notebookfR</STRONG> <STRONG>command</STRONG> <STRONG>creates</STRONG> <STRONG>a</STRONG> <STRONG>new</STRONG> <STRONG>Tcl</STRONG> <STRONG>command</STRONG> <STRONG>whose</STRONG>  <STRONG>name</STRONG>
     <STRONG>is</STRONG>  <EM>pathName</EM>.  This  command  may  be used to invoke various
     operations on the widget. It has the following general form:

          <EM>pathName</EM> <EM>option</EM> ?<EM>arg</EM> <EM>arg</EM> ...?

     <EM>option</EM> and the <EM>arg</EM>s determine the exact behavior of the com-
     mand.

     Many of the widget commands for a notebook take as one argu-
     ment  an  indicator of which page of the notebook to operate
     on. These indicators are called indexes and may be specified
     in any of the following forms:

     <EM>number</EM>
          Specifies the index of the the component. For menus,  0
          corresponds  to the left-most menu of the menu bar. For
          entries, 0 corresponds to the  top-most  entry  of  the
          menu.   <EM>number</EM>  Specifies the page numerically, where 0
          corresponds to the first page in the notebook, 1 to the
          second, and so on.

     <STRONG>select</STRONG>
          Specifies the currently selected page's  index.  If  no
          page is currently selected, the value -1 is returned.

     <STRONG>end</STRONG>  Specifes the last page in the notebooks's index. If the
          notebook is empty this will return -1.

     <EM>pattern</EM>
          If the index doesn't satisfy the form of a number, then
          this  form  is used. Pattern is pattern-matched against
          the <STRONG>label</STRONG> of each page in the notebook, in  order  from
          the  first  to the last page, until a matching entry is
          found. The rules of <STRONG>Tcl_StringMatch</STRONG> are used.

     The following commands are possible for notebook widgets:

     <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>add</STRONG> ?<EM>option</EM> <EM>value</EM>?
          Add a new page at the end of the notebook. A new  child
          site frame is created. Returns the child site pathName.
          If additional arguments are present, they  specify  any
          of the following options:

          <STRONG>-background</STRONG> <EM>value</EM>
               Specifies a background color to use for displaying
               the  child site frame of this page. If this option
               is specified as an  empty  string  (the  default),
               then  the  background option for the overall note-
               book is used.

          <STRONG>-command</STRONG> <EM>value</EM>
               Specifies a Tcl command to be executed  when  this
               page  is  selected.  This  allows the programmer a
               hook to reconfigure this  page's  widgets  or  any
               other page's widgets.

               If the notebook has the auto option set  to  true,
               when  a  page  is  selected  this  command will be
               called immediately after the  previously  selected
               page  is unpacked and immediately before this page
               is selected. The index value select is valid  dur-
               ing  this  Tcl command. `index select' will return
               this page's page number.

               If the auto option is set to false, when a page is
               selected  the  unpack and pack calls are bypassed.
               This Tcl command is still called.

          <STRONG>-foreground</STRONG> <EM>value</EM>
               Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying
               tab   labels   when   tabs  are  in  their  normal
               unselected state. If this option is  specified  as
               an empty string (the default), then the foreground
               option for the overall notebook is used.

          <STRONG>-label</STRONG> <EM>value</EM>
               Specifies a string to associate  with  this  page.
               This label serves as an additional identifier used
               to reference the page. This label may be used  for
               the index value in widget commands.

     <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>childSite</STRONG> ?<EM>index</EM>?
          If passed no arguments, returns a list of pathNames for
          all  the  pages  in  the  notebook.  If the notebook is
          empty, an empty list is returned

          If index is passed, it returns  the  pathName  for  the
          page's  child  site  frame  specified by index. Widgets
          that are created with this pathName will  be  displayed
          when the associated page is selected. If index is not a
          valid index, an empty string is returned.

     <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>cget</STRONG> <EM>option</EM>
          Returns the current value of the  configuration  option
          given by <EM>option</EM>.

     <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>configure</STRONG> ?<EM>option</EM>? ?<EM>value</EM> <EM>option</EM> <EM>value</EM> ...?
          Query  or  modify  the  configuration  options  of  the
          widget.  If  no  <EM>option</EM>  is  specified,  returns a list
          describing all of the available  options  for  <EM>pathName</EM>
          (see  <STRONG>Tk_ConfigureInfo</STRONG> for information on the format of
          this list). If <EM>option</EM> is specified with no <EM>value</EM>,  then
          the  command  returns  a  list describing the one named
          option (this list will be identical to the  correspond-
          ing  sublist  of  the  value  returned  if no option is
          specified). If  one  or  more  option-value  pairs  are
          specified,  then  the command modifies the given widget
          option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case  the
          command returns an empty string. <EM>Option</EM> may have any of
          the values accepted by the <STRONG>notebook</STRONG> command.

     <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>delete</STRONG> <EM>index1</EM> ?index2?
          Delete all of  the  pages  between  <EM>index1</EM>  and  <EM>index2</EM>
          inclusive.  If  <EM>index2</EM>  is  omitted then it defaults to
          <EM>index1</EM>. Returns an empty string.

     <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>index</STRONG> <EM>index</EM>
          Returns the numerical index corresponding to <EM>index</EM>.

     <STRONG>pathName</STRONG> <STRONG>insert</STRONG> <EM>index</EM> ?<EM>option</EM> <EM>value</EM>?
          Insert a new page  in  the  notebook  before  the  page
          specified  by <EM>index</EM>. A new child site <STRONG>frame</STRONG> is created.
          See the <STRONG>add</STRONG> command  for  valid  options.  Returns  the
          child site pathName.

     <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>next</STRONG>
          Advances the selected page to the next page  (order  is
          determined   by  insertion  order).  If  the  currently
          selected page is the last page  in  the  notebook,  the
          selection  wraps  around to the first page in the note-
          book.

          For notebooks with auto set to true the current  page's
          child  site  is unpacked from the notebook's child site
          frame. Then the next page's child site is  packed  into
          the  notebooks  child site frame. The Tcl command given
          with the command option will be invoked  between  these
          two operations.

          For notebooks with auto set to false  the  Tcl  command
          given with the command option will be invoked.

     <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>pagecget</STRONG> <EM>index</EM> ?<EM>option</EM>?
          Returns the current value of the  configuration  option
          given  by  <EM>option</EM>  for the page specified by <EM>index</EM>. The
          valid available options are the same  as  available  to
          the <STRONG>add</STRONG> command.

     <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>pageconfigure</STRONG> <EM>index</EM> ?<EM>option</EM>? ?<EM>value</EM> <EM>option</EM> <EM>value</EM> ...?
          This  command  is  similar  to  the  configure command,
          except that it applies to the options for an individual
          page,  whereas configure applies to the options for the
          notebook. Options may have any of the  values  accepted
          by  the  add  widget command. If options are specified,
          options are modified as indicated in  the  command  and
          the  command returns an empty string. If no options are
          specified,  returns  a  list  describing  the   current
          options for page <EM>index</EM> (see <STRONG>Tk_ConfigureInfo</STRONG> for infor-
          mation on the format of this list).

     <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>prev</STRONG>
          Moves the selected page to the previous page (order  is
          determined   by  insertion  order).  If  the  currently
          selected page is the first page in  the  notebook,  the
          selection  wraps  around  to the last page in the note-
          book.

          For notebooks with <STRONG>auto</STRONG> set to <STRONG>true</STRONG> the current  page's
          child  site  is unpacked from the notebook's child site
          frame. Then the previous page's child  site  is  packed
          into  the  notebooks  child site frame. The Tcl command
          given with the command option will be  invoked  between
          these two operations.

          For notebooks with <STRONG>auto</STRONG> set to <STRONG>false</STRONG>  the  Tcl  command
          given with the command option will be invoked.

     <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>select</STRONG> <EM>index</EM>
          Selects the page specified by <EM>index</EM>  as  the  currently
          selected page.

          For notebooks with <STRONG>auto</STRONG> set to <STRONG>true</STRONG> the current  page's
          child  site  is unpacked from the notebook's child site
          frame. Then the index page's child site is packed  into
          the  notebooks  child site frame. The Tcl command given
          with the command option will be invoked  between  these
          two operations.

          For notebooks with <STRONG>auto</STRONG> set to <STRONG>false</STRONG>  the  Tcl  command
          given with the command option will be invoked.

     <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>view</STRONG>
          Returns the currently selected page.  This  command  is
          for compatibility with the scrollbar widget.

     <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>view</STRONG> <EM>index</EM>
          Selects the page specified by <EM>index</EM>  as  the  currently
          selected  page.  This command is for compatibility with
          the scrollbar widget.

     <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>view</STRONG> <EM>moveto</EM> <EM>fraction</EM>
          Uses the fraction value to determine the  corresponding
          page to move to. This command is for compatibility with
          the scrollbar widget.

     <EM>pathName</EM> <STRONG>view</STRONG> <EM>scroll</EM> <EM>num</EM> <EM>what</EM>
          Uses the <EM>num</EM> value to determine how many pages to  move
          forward  or backward (num can be negative or positive).
          The <EM>what</EM> argument is ignored. This command is for  com-
          patibility with the scrollbar widget.



</PRE>
<H2>EXAMPLE</H2><PRE>
     Following is an example that creates  a  notebook  with  two
     pages. In this example, we use a scrollbar widget to control
     the notebook widget.

          # Create the notebook widget and pack it.
            notebook .nb -width 100 -height 100
            pack .nb -anchor nw \
                  -fill both \
                  -expand yes \
                  -side left \
                  -padx 10 \
                  -pady 10

          # Add two pages to the notebook, labelled
          # "Page One" and "Page Two", respectively.
            .nb add -label "Page One"
            .nb add -label "Page Two"

          # Get the child site frames of these two pages.
            set page1CS [.nb childsite 0]
            set page2CS [.nb childsite "Page Two"]

          # Create buttons on each page of the notebook
            button $page1CS.b -text "Button One"
            pack $page1CS.b
            button $page2CS.b -text "Button Two"
            pack $page2CS.b

          # Select the first page of the notebook
            .nb select 0

          # Create the scrollbar and associate teh scrollbar
          # and the notebook together, then pack the scrollbar
            ScrollBar .scroll -command ".nb view"
            .nb configure -scrollcommand ".scroll set"
            pack .scroll -fill y -expand yes -pady 10

<P>
<pre>
Name:                   <B>auto</B>
Class:                  <B>Auto</B>
Command-Line Switch:	<B>-auto</B>
</pre>
<UL>
Specifies whether to use the automatic packing/unpacking algorithm of the
notebook. A value of <B>true</B> indicates that page frames will be unpacked 
and packed acoording to the algorithm described in the <B>select</B> command. 
A value of <B>false</B> leaves the current page packed and subsequent selects, 
next, or previous commands do not switch pages automatically. In either 
case the page's associated command (see the <B>add</B> command's description 
of the <B>command</B> option) is invoked. The value may have any of the 
forms accepted by the <B>Tcl_GetBoolean</B>, such as true, false, 0, 1, yes, 
or no.

For example, if a series of pages in a notebook simply change certain display
configurations of a graphical display, the <B>-auto</B> flag could be used. 
By setting it, the <B>-command</B> procs could do the appropriate reconfiguring
of the page when the page is switched.
</UL>
</pre><HR>
</pre><H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>
<P>
The <B>notebook</B> command creates a new window (given by the pathName 
argument) and makes it into a notebook widget. Additional options, described 
above may be specified on the command line or in the option database to 
configure aspects of the notebook such as its colors, font, and text. 
The <B>notebook</B> command returns its <I>pathName</I> argument. At the time 
this command is invoked, there must not exist a window named pathName, but 
pathName's parent must exist.

A notebook is a widget that contains a set of pages. It displays one page from 
the set as the selected page. When a page is selected, the page's contents are 
displayed in the page area. When first created a notebook has no pages. Pages 
may be added or deleted using widget commands described below.

</pre><H2>NOTEBOOK PAGES</H2>
<P>
A notebook's pages area contains a single child site <B>frame</B>. When a new 
page is created it is a child of this frame. The page's child site frame 
serves as a geometry container for applications to pack widgets into. It is 
this frame that is automatically unpacked or packed when the <B>auto</B> 
option is <B>true</B>. This creates the effect of one page being visible at 
a time. When a new page is selected, the previously selected page's child 
site frame is automatically unpacked from the notebook's child site frame 
and the newly selected page's child site is packed into the notebook's 
child site frame.

However, sometimes it is desirable to handle page changes in a different 
manner. By specifying the <B>auto</B> option as <B>false</B>, child site 
packing can be disabled and done differently. For example, all widgets might 
be packed into the first page's child site frame. Then when a new page is 
selected, the application can reconfigure the widgets and give the appearance
that the page was flipped.

In both cases the <B>command</B> option for a page specifies a Tcl Command to
execute when the page is selected. In the case of <B>auto</B> being <B>true</B>, 
it is called between the unpacking of the previously selected page and the 
packing of the newly selected page.

</pre><H2>WIDGET-SPECIFIC METHODS</H2>
<P>
The <B>notebookfR command creates a new Tcl command whose name 
is <I>pathName</I>. This command may be used to invoke various operations 
on the widget. It has the following general form:
<pre>
<I>pathName option </I>?<I>arg arg ...</I>?
</pre>
<I>option</I> and the <I>arg</I>s
determine the exact behavior of the command.
<P>
Many of the widget commands for a notebook take as one argument an indicator 
of which page of the notebook to operate on. These indicators are called 
indexes and may be specified in any of the following forms:
<DL>
<DT> <I>number</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies the index of the the component. For menus, 0 corresponds to the 
left-most menu of the menu bar. For entries, 0 corresponds to the top-most 
entry of the menu.
<I>number</I>
Specifies the page numerically, where 0 corresponds to the first page in 
the notebook, 1 to the second, and so on.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>select</B>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies the currently selected page's index. If no page is currently 
selected, the value -1 is returned.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>end</B>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifes the last page in the notebooks's index. If the notebook is empty 
this will return -1.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pattern</I>
</I></B>
<DD> If the index doesn't satisfy the form of a number, then this form is used. 
Pattern is pattern-matched against the <B>label</B> of each page in the 
notebook, in order from the first to the last page, until a matching entry 
is found. The rules of <B>Tcl_StringMatch</B> are used.
</DL>
<P>
'.............................................................................
The following commands are possible for notebook widgets:
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>add</B> ?<I>option value</I>?
</I></B>
<DD> Add a new page at the end of the notebook. A new child site frame is 
created. Returns the child site pathName. If additional arguments are 
present, they specify any of the following options:
</DL>
<UL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-background</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a background color to use for displaying the child site frame 
of this page. If this option is specified as an empty string (the default), 
then the background option for the overall notebook is used.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-command</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a Tcl command to be executed when this page is selected. This 
allows the programmer a hook to reconfigure this page's widgets or any other
page's widgets.
<UL>
If the notebook has the auto option set to true, when a page is selected 
this command will be called immediately after the previously selected page 
is unpacked and immediately before this page is selected. The index value 
select is valid during this Tcl command. `index select' will return this 
page's page number. 
</UL>
<UL>
If the auto option is set to false, when a page is selected the unpack and 
pack calls are bypassed. This Tcl command is still called.
</UL>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-foreground</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a foreground color to use for displaying tab labels when tabs are 
in their normal unselected state. If this option is specified as an empty 
string (the default), then the foreground option for the overall notebook 
is used. 
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>-label</B> <I>value</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Specifies a string to associate with this page. This label serves as an 
additional identifier used to reference the page. This label may be used 
for the index value in widget commands. 
</DL>
</UL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>childSite</B> ?<I>index</I>?
</I></B>
<DD> If passed no arguments, returns a list of pathNames for all the pages in 
the notebook. If the notebook is empty, an empty list is returned
<UL>
If index is passed, it returns the pathName for the page's child site 
frame specified by index. Widgets that are created with this pathName will 
be displayed when the associated page is selected. If index is not a valid 
index, an empty string is returned. 
</UL>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>cget</B> <I>option</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <I>option</I>.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>configure</B> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> ...?
</I></B>
<DD> Query or modify the configuration options of the widget. If no <I>option</I> 
is specified, returns a list describing all of the available options 
for <I>pathName</I> (see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for information on the 
format of this list). If <I>option</I> is specified with no <I>value</I>, 
then the command returns a list describing the one named option (this 
list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned 
if no option is specified). If one or more option-value pairs are specified, 
then the command modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given 
value(s); in this case the command returns an empty string. <I>Option</I> 
may have any of the values accepted by the <B>notebook</B> command.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>delete</B> <I>index1</I> ?i</B></I>ndex2?
</I></B>
<DD> Delete all of the pages between <I>index1</I> and <I>index2</I> inclusive. 
If <I>index2</I> is omitted then it defaults to <I>index1</I>. Returns an 
empty string.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>index</B> <I>index</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Returns the numerical index corresponding to <I>index</I>.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <B>pathName</B> <B>insert</B> <I>index</I> ?<I>option</I> <I>value</I>?
</I></B>
<DD> Insert a new page in the notebook before the page specified by <I>index</I>. 
A new child site <B>frame</B> is created. See the <B>add</B> command for 
valid options. Returns the child site pathName.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>next</B>
</I></B>
<DD> Advances the selected page to the next page (order is determined by insertion 
order). If the currently selected page is the last page in the notebook, 
the selection wraps around to the first page in the notebook. 
<UL>
For notebooks with auto set to true the current page's child site is 
unpacked from the notebook's child site frame. Then the next page's child 
site is packed into the notebooks child site frame. The Tcl command given 
with the command option will be invoked between these two operations.
</UL>
<UL>
For notebooks with auto set to false the Tcl command given with the 
command option will be invoked.
</UL>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>pagecget</B> <I>index</I> ?<I>option</I>?
</I></B>
<DD> Returns the current value of the configuration option given by <I>option</I> 
for the page specified by <I>index</I>. The valid available options are the 
same as available to the <B>add</B> command.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>pageconfigure</B> <I>index</I> ?<I>option</I>? ?<I>value</I> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> ...?
</I></B>
<DD> This command is similar to the configure command, except that it applies to 
the options for an individual page, whereas configure applies to the options 
for the notebook. Options may have any of the values accepted by the add 
widget command. If options are specified, options are modified as indicated 
in the command and the command returns an empty string. If no options are 
specified, returns a list describing the current options for 
page <I>index</I> (see <B>Tk_ConfigureInfo</B> for information on the 
format of this list).
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>prev</B>
</I></B>
<DD> Moves the selected page to the previous page (order is determined by 
insertion order). If the currently selected page is the first page in the 
notebook, the selection wraps around to the last page in the notebook.
<UL>
For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>true</B> the current page's child 
site is unpacked from the notebook's child site frame. Then the previous 
page's child site is packed into the notebooks child site frame. The Tcl 
command given with the command option will be invoked between these two 
operations.
</UL>
<UL>
For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>false</B> the Tcl command given with 
the command option will be invoked.
</UL>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>select</B> <I>index</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Selects the page specified by <I>index</I> as the currently selected page.
<UL>
For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>true</B> the current page's child 
site is unpacked from the notebook's child site frame. Then the index page's 
child site is packed into the notebooks child site frame. The Tcl command 
given with the command option will be invoked between these two operations.
</UL>
<UL>
For notebooks with <B>auto</B> set to <B>false</B> the Tcl command given with 
the command option will be invoked.
</UL>
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>view</B>
</I></B>
<DD> Returns the currently selected page. This command is for compatibility 
with the scrollbar widget.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>view</B> <I>index</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Selects the page specified by <I>index</I> as the currently selected page. 
This command is for compatibility with the scrollbar widget.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>view</B> <I>moveto</I> <I>fraction</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Uses the fraction value to determine the corresponding page to move to. 
This command is for compatibility with the scrollbar widget.
</DL>
<DL>
<DT> <I>pathName</I> <B>view</B> <I>scroll</I> <I>num</I> <I>what</I>
</I></B>
<DD> Uses the <I>num</I> value to determine how many pages to move forward or 
backward (num can be negative or positive). The <I>what</I> argument is 
ignored. This command is for compatibility with the scrollbar widget.
