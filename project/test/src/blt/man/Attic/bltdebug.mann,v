.SH NAME
bltdebug \- print Tcl commands before execution
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbltdebug\fR ?\fIlevel\fR?
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBbltdebug\fR command is a simple tracing facility for Tcl commands.
Each command line is printed before it is executed on standard error.
The output consists of the command line both before and after
substitutions have occurred.  \fILevel\fR indicates at what level to
stop tracing commands.  If \fIlevel\fR is \f(CW0\fR, no tracing is
performed. This is the default.  If no \fIlevel\fR argument is given,
the current level is printed.
