.SH NAME
cutbuffer \- Manipulate X cut buffer properties
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcutbuffer\fI get ?number?\fR
.br
\fBcutbuffer\fI rotate ?count?\fR
.br
\fBcutbuffer\fI set value ?number?\fR
.BE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBcutbuffer\fR command allows you to read or modify the eight X cut
buffer properties. You can also rotate the buffers properties.
.SH OPERATIONS
The following operations are available for the \fBcutbuffer\fR command:
.TP
\fBcutbuffer get \fI?number?\fR 
Returns the value of a cutbuffer \fInumber\fR.  \fINumber\fR must be a
number between 0 and 7.  The default is 0.  The cutbuffer is returned
exactly, except that NUL bytes are converted to '@@' characters.  If a
cut buffer \fInumber\fR does not exist, then \f(CW""\fR is returned.
.TP
\fBcutbuffer rotate \fI?count?\fR 
Rotates the cut buffers by \fIcount\fR. \fICount\fR must be a number
between -7 and 7. The default is 1.
.TP
\fBcutbuffer set \fIvalue\fR ?\fInumber\fR?  
Sets the cutbuffer \fInumber\fR to \fIvalue\fR.  \fINumber\fR must be a
number between 0 and 7.  The default is 0.
