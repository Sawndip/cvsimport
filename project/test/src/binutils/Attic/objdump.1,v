.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\f(CW\*(C`objdump\*(C'\fR displays information about one or more object files.
The options control what particular information to display.  This
information is mostly useful to programmers who are working on the
compilation tools, as opposed to programmers who just want their
program to compile and work.
.PP
\&\fIobjfile\fR... are the object files to be examined.  When you
specify archives, \f(CW\*(C`objdump\*(C'\fR shows information on each of the member
object files.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The long and short forms of options, shown here as alternatives, are
equivalent.  At least one option from the list
\&\fB\-a,\-d,\-D,\-f,\-g,\-G,\-h,\-H,\-p,\-r,\-R,\-S,\-t,\-T,\-V,\-x\fR must be given. 
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-a\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-archive\-header\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--archive-header"
If any of the \fIobjfile\fR files are archives, display the archive
header information (in a format similar to \fBls \-l\fR).  Besides the
information you could list with \fBar tv\fR, \fBobjdump \-a\fR shows
the object file format of each archive member.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-adjust\-vma=\f(CIoffset\f(CW\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--adjust-vma=offset"
When dumping information, first add \fIoffset\fR to all the section
addresses.  This is useful if the section addresses do not correspond to
the symbol table, which can happen when putting sections at particular
addresses when using a format which can not represent section addresses,
such as a.out.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-b \f(CIbfdname\f(CW\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b bfdname"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-target=\f(CIbfdname\f(CW\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--target=bfdname"
Specify that the object-code format for the object files is
\&\fIbfdname\fR.  This option may not be necessary; \fIobjdump\fR can
automatically recognize many formats.
.Sp
For example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        objdump -b oasys -m vax -h fu.o
.Ve
displays summary information from the section headers (\fB\-h\fR) of
\&\fIfu.o\fR, which is explicitly identified (\fB\-m\fR) as a \s-1VAX\s0 object
file in the format produced by Oasys compilers.  You can list the
formats available with the \fB\-i\fR option.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-C\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-demangle[=\f(CIstyle\f(CW]\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--demangle[=style]"
Decode (\fIdemangle\fR) low-level symbol names into user-level names.
Besides removing any initial underscore prepended by the system, this
makes \*(C+ function names readable.  Different compilers have different
mangling styles. The optional demangling style argument can be used to 
choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler. 
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-G\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-G"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-debugging\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--debugging"
Display debugging information.  This attempts to parse debugging
information stored in the file and print it out using a C like syntax.
Only certain types of debugging information have been implemented.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-d\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-disassemble\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--disassemble"
Display the assembler mnemonics for the machine instructions from
\&\fIobjfile\fR.  This option only disassembles those sections which are
expected to contain instructions.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-D\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-disassemble\-all\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--disassemble-all"
Like \fB\-d\fR, but disassemble the contents of all sections, not just
those expected to contain instructions.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-prefix\-addresses\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--prefix-addresses"
When disassembling, print the complete address on each line.  This is
the older disassembly format.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-disassemble\-zeroes\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--disassemble-zeroes"
Normally the disassembly output will skip blocks of zeroes.  This
option directs the disassembler to disassemble those blocks, just like
any other data.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-EB\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EB"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-EL\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EL"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-endian={big|little}\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--endian={big|little}"
Specify the endianness of the object files.  This only affects
disassembly.  This can be useful when disassembling a file format which
does not describe endianness information, such as S-records.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-file\-header\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--file-header"
Display summary information from the overall header of
each of the \fIobjfile\fR files.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-file\-start\-context\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--file-start-context"
Specify that when displaying interlisted source code/disassembly
(assumes '\-S') from a file that has not yet been displayed, extend the
context to the start of the file.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-h\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-section\-header\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--section-header"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-header\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--header"
Display summary information from the section headers of the
object file.
.Sp
File segments may be relocated to nonstandard addresses, for example by
using the \fB\-Ttext\fR, \fB\-Tdata\fR, or \fB\-Tbss\fR options to
\&\f(CW\*(C`ld\*(C'\fR.  However, some object file formats, such as a.out, do not
store the starting address of the file segments.  In those situations,
although \f(CW\*(C`ld\*(C'\fR relocates the sections correctly, using \fBobjdump
\&\-h\fR to list the file section headers cannot show the correct addresses.
Instead, it shows the usual addresses, which are implicit for the
target.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-help\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Print a summary of the options to \f(CW\*(C`objdump\*(C'\fR and exit.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-i\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-info\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--info"
Display a list showing all architectures and object formats available
for specification with \fB\-b\fR or \fB\-m\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-j \f(CIname\f(CW\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-j name"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-section=\f(CIname\f(CW\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--section=name"
Display information only for section \fIname\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-l\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-line\-numbers\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--line-numbers"
Label the display (using debugging information) with the filename and
source line numbers corresponding to the object code or relocs shown.
Only useful with \fB\-d\fR, \fB\-D\fR, or \fB\-r\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-m \f(CImachine\f(CW\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m machine"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-architecture=\f(CImachine\f(CW\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--architecture=machine"
Specify the architecture to use when disassembling object files.  This
can be useful when disassembling object files which do not describe
architecture information, such as S-records.  You can list the available
architectures with the \fB\-i\fR option.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-M \f(CIoptions\f(CW\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M options"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-disassembler\-options=\f(CIoptions\f(CW\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--disassembler-options=options"
Pass target specific information to the disassembler.  Only supported on
some targets.
.Sp
If the target is an \s-1ARM\s0 architecture then this switch can be used to
select which register name set is used during disassembler.  Specifying
\&\fB\-M reg-name-std\fR (the default) will select the register names as
used in \s-1ARM\s0's instruction set documentation, but with register 13 called
\&'sp', register 14 called 'lr' and register 15 called 'pc'.  Specifying
\&\fB\-M reg-names-apcs\fR will select the name set used by the \s-1ARM\s0
Procedure Call Standard, whilst specifying \fB\-M reg-names-raw\fR will
just use \fBr\fR followed by the register number.
.Sp
There are also two variants on the \s-1APCS\s0 register naming scheme enabled
by \fB\-M reg-names-atpcs\fR and \fB\-M reg-names-special-atpcs\fR which
use the ARM/Thumb Procedure Call Standard naming conventions.  (Eiuther
with the normal register name sor the special register names).
.Sp
This option can also be used for \s-1ARM\s0 architectures to force the
disassembler to interpret all instructions as \s-1THUMB\s0 instructions by
using the switch \fB\*(--disassembler-options=force-thumb\fR.  This can be
useful when attempting to disassemble thumb code produced by other
compilers.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-p\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-private\-headers\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--private-headers"
Print information that is specific to the object file format.  The exact
information printed depends upon the object file format.  For some
object file formats, no additional information is printed.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-r\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-reloc\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--reloc"
Print the relocation entries of the file.  If used with \fB\-d\fR or
\&\fB\-D\fR, the relocations are printed interspersed with the
disassembly.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-R\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-R"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-dynamic\-reloc\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dynamic-reloc"
Print the dynamic relocation entries of the file.  This is only
meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain types of shared
libraries.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-s\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-full\-contents\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--full-contents"
Display the full contents of any sections requested.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-S\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-source\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--source"
Display source code intermixed with disassembly, if possible.  Implies
\&\fB\-d\fR.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-show\-raw\-insn\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--show-raw-insn"
When disassembling instructions, print the instruction in hex as well as
in symbolic form.  This is the default except when
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-prefix\-addresses\*(C'\fR is used.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-no\-show\-raw\-insn\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-show-raw-insn"
When disassembling instructions, do not print the instruction bytes.
This is the default when \f(CW\*(C`\-\-prefix\-addresses\*(C'\fR is used.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-G\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-G"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-stabs\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--stabs"
Display the full contents of any sections requested.  Display the
contents of the .stab and .stab.index and .stab.excl sections from an
\&\s-1ELF\s0 file.  This is only useful on systems (such as Solaris 2.0) in which
\&\f(CW\*(C`.stab\*(C'\fR debugging symbol-table entries are carried in an \s-1ELF\s0
section.  In most other file formats, debugging symbol-table entries are
interleaved with linkage symbols, and are visible in the \fB\*(--syms\fR
output.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-start\-address=\f(CIaddress\f(CW\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--start-address=address"
Start displaying data at the specified address.  This affects the output
of the \f(CW\*(C`\-d\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-r\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-s\*(C'\fR options.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-stop\-address=\f(CIaddress\f(CW\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--stop-address=address"
Stop displaying data at the specified address.  This affects the output
of the \f(CW\*(C`\-d\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-r\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-s\*(C'\fR options.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-t\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-syms\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--syms"
Print the symbol table entries of the file.
This is similar to the information provided by the \fBnm\fR program.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-T\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-T"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-dynamic\-syms\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dynamic-syms"
Print the dynamic symbol table entries of the file.  This is only
meaningful for dynamic objects, such as certain types of shared
libraries.  This is similar to the information provided by the \fBnm\fR
program when given the \fB\-D\fR (\fB\*(--dynamic\fR) option.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-version\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Print the version number of \f(CW\*(C`objdump\*(C'\fR and exit.
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-x\*(C'\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x"
.Ip "\f(CW\*(C`\-\-all\-header\*(C'\fR" 4

\"  0. PREAMBLE
\"  .PP
\"  The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
\"  written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
\"  the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
\"  modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
\"  this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
\"  credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
\"  modifications made by others.
\"  .PP
\"  This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
\"  works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
\"  complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
\"  license designed for free software.
\"  .PP
\"  We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
\"  software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
\"  program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
\"  software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
\"  it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
\"  whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
\"  principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
\"  .PP
\"  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
\"  .PP
\"  This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
\"  notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
\"  under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
\"  such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
\"  addressed as "you".
\"  .PP
\"  A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
\"  Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
\"  modifications and/or translated into another language.
\"  .PP
\"  A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
\"  the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
\"  publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
\"  (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
\"  within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
\"  textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
\"  mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
\"  connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
\"  commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
\"  them.
\"  .PP
\"  The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
\"  are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
\"  that says that the Document is released under this License.
\"  .PP
\"  The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
\"  as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
\"  the Document is released under this License.
\"  .PP
\"  A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
\"  represented in a format whose specification is available to the
\"  general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
\"  straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
\"  pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
\"  drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
\"  for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
\"  to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
\"  format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
\"  subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
\"  not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
\"  .PP
\"  Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
\"  ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
\"  or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
\"  HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
\"  PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
\"  by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
\"  processing tools are not generally available, and the
\"  machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
\"  purposes only.
\"  .PP
\"  The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
\"  plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
\"  this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
\"  formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
\"  the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
\"  preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
\"  .PP
\"  2. VERBATIM COPYING
\"  .PP
\"  You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
\"  commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
\"  copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
\"  to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
\"  conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
\"  technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
\"  copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
\"  compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
\"  number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
\"  .PP
\"  You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
\"  you may publicly display copies.
\"  .PP
\"  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
\"  .PP
\"  If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
\"  and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
\"  the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
\"  Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
\"  the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
\"  you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
\"  the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
\"  visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
\"  Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
\"  the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
\"  as verbatim copying in other respects.
\"  .PP
\"  If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
\"  legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
\"  reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
\"  pages.
\"  .PP
\"  If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
\"  more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
\"  copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
\"  a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
\"  Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
\"  general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
\"  charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
\"  option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
\"  distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
\"  Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
\"  until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
\"  copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
\"  the public.
\"  .PP
\"  It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
\"  Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
\"  them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
\"  .PP
\"  4. MODIFICATIONS
\"  .PP
\"  You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
\"  the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
\"  the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
\"  Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
\"  and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
\"  of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
\"  .PP
\"  A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
\"  from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
\"  (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
\"  of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
\"  if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
\"  .PP
\"  B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
\"  responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
\"  Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
\"  Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
\"  .PP
\"  C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
\"  Modified Version, as the publisher.
\"  .PP
\"  D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
\"  .PP
\"  E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
\"  adjacent to the other copyright notices.
\"  .PP
\"  F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
\"  giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
\"  terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
\"  Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
\"  and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
\"  .PP
\"  H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
\"  .PP
\"  I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
\"  it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
\"  publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
\"  there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
\"  stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
\"  given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
\"  Version as stated in the previous sentence.
\"  .PP
\"  J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
\"  public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
\"  the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
\"  it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
\"  You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
\"  least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
\"  publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
\"  .PP
\"  K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
\"  preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
\"  substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
\"  and/or dedications given therein.
\"  .PP
\"  L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
\"  unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
\"  or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
\"  .PP
\"  M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
\"  may not be included in the Modified Version.
\"  .PP
\"  N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
\"  or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
\"  .PP
\"  If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
\"  appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
\"  copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
\"  of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
\"  list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
\"  These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
\"  .PP
\"  You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
\"  nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
\"  parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
\"  been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
\"  standard.
\"  .PP
\"  You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
\"  passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
\"  of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
\"  Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
\"  through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
\"  includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
\"  by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
\"  you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
\"  permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
\"  .PP
\"  The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
\"  give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
\"  imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
\"  .PP

\"  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
\"  .PP
\"  You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
\"  License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
\"  versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
\"  Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
\"  list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
\"  license notice.
\"  .PP
\"  The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
\"  multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
\"  copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
\"  different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
\"  adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
\"  author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
\"  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
\"  Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
\"  .PP
\"  In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
\"  in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
\"  "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
\"  and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
\"  entitled "Endorsements."
\"  .PP

\"  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
\"  .PP
\"  You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
\"  released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
\"  License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
\"  the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
\"  verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
\"  .PP
\"  You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
\"  it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
\"  License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
\"  other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
\"  .PP

\"  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
\"  .PP
\"  A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
\"  and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
\"  distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
\"  of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
\"  compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
\"  License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
\"  with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
\"  are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
\"  .PP
\"  If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
\"  copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
\"  of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
\"  covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
\"  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
\"  .PP

\"  8. TRANSLATION
\"  .PP
\"  Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
\"  distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
\"  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
\"  permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
\"  translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
\"  original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
\"  translation of this License provided that you also include the
\"  original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
\"  between the translation and the original English version of this
\"  License, the original English version will prevail.
\"  .PP

\"  9. TERMINATION
\"  .PP
\"  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
\"  as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
\"  copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
\"  automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
\"  parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
\"  License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
\"  parties remain in full compliance.
\"  .PP

\"  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
\"  .PP
\"  The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
\"  of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
\"  versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
\"  differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
\"  http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
\"  .PP
\"  Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
\"  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
\"  License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
\"  following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
\"  of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
\"  Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
\"  number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
\"  as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
\"  .PP

\"  ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
\"  .PP
\"  To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
\"  the License in the document and put the following copyright and
\"  license notices just after the title page:
\"  .PP
\"      Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
\"      Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or
\"      modify this document under the terms of the GNU
\"      Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later
\"      version published by the Free Software Foundation;
\"      with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES,
\"      with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the
\"      Back-Cover Texts being LIST.  A copy of the license
\"      is included in the section entitled "GNU Free
\"      Documentation License".
\"  .PP
\"  If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
\"  instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
\"  Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
\"  "Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.
\"  .PP
\"  If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
\"  recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
\"  free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
\"  to permit their use in free software.

credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.
.PP
This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.
.PP
We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
.PP
1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS
.PP
This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".
.PP
A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.
.PP
A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.
.PP
The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.
.PP
The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.
.PP
A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".
.PP
Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
HTML designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include
PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
purposes only.
.PP
The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
.PP
2. VERBATIM COPYING
.PP
You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.
.PP
You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.
.PP
3. COPYING IN QUANTITY
.PP
If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition.
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.
.PP
If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.
.PP
If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.
.PP
It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.
.PP
4. MODIFICATIONS
.PP
You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:
.PP
A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
.PP
B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
.PP
C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.
.PP
D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
.PP
E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.
.PP
F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
.PP
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
.PP
I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.
.PP
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
.PP
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
and/or dedications given therein.
.PP
L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
.PP
M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.
.PP
N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"
or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
.PP
If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.
.PP
You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.
.PP
You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.
.PP
The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
.PP

a669 24
5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS
.PP
You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.
.PP
The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.
.PP
In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."
.PP
d671 13
a683 13
6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS
.PP
You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.
.PP
You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.
.PP
d685 17
a701 17
7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS
.PP
A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.
.PP
If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
.PP
d703 13
a715 13
8. TRANSLATION
.PP
Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.
.PP
d717 10
a726 10
9. TERMINATION
.PP
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
.PP
d728 17
a744 17
10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE
.PP
The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.
.PP
Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
.PP
To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:
.PP
    Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
    Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or
    modify this document under the terms of the GNU
    Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later
    version published by the Free Software Foundation;
    with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES,
    with the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the
    Back-Cover Texts being LIST.  A copy of the license
    is included in the section entitled "GNU Free
    Documentation License".
.PP
If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of
"Front-Cover Texts being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.
.PP
If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
