@SID - an embedded system simulation framework
Copyright 1999, 2000 Red Hat.

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2, or (at your option)

Note 1:

The SID simulator framework is designed to allow independently built
component libraries to plug into an executable, according to a
standard open API and run-time linking ABI.  It is our position
that such runtime dynamic linking is mere aggregation for purposes of
Copyright, and therefore, SID component libraries are not automatically
considered derived works of each other or of an executable.  This means
that third party components do not have to be covered by the GNU General
Public License, merely by virtue of being potentially loaded together
within a SID simulation.  This clause does not however invalidate
any other reasons why the component library or executable might be
covered by the GNU General Public License.


Note 2:

The header files in the include/ subdirectory are licensed under
the GPL with the following exception clause.    These files may be
used as a part of a free software library without restriction. 
Specifically, if a component library or executable instantiates templates or
use macros or inline functions from these files, these files do not by
themselves cause the resulting component library or executable to be
covered by the GNU General Public License.  This exception does not
however invalidate any other reasons why the component library or
executable file might be covered by the GNU General Public License.
