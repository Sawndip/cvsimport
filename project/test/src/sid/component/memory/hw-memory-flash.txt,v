@            hw-memory-flash (libmemory.la :: mem_component_library)

Synopsis:

   This is a simulated ATMEL AT29 or AMD Am29 series flash memory. It can be
   configured to emulate any of the AT29 or Am29 family members.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Functionality:

  Modelling:

   Memory operations such as programming and erasing are achieved instantly
   in simulation. As such, device facilities for performing in-progress
   operations such as suspending and resuming erase operations are not
   implemented.

   Hardware sector protection is not implemented.

   In the actual hardware, the ATMEL flash memory has timing sensitivities
   when programming sectors. During such programming, the final byte that is
   modified in a sector is set to an incorrect value until the programming
   has been completed. In simulation, the programming of a sector appears to
   be instantaneous. Therefore, it may not be possible to detect software
   programs that are not sensitive to the timing requirements in real
   hardware.

   In AMTEL components, the data security facility that prevents the memory
   from being inadvertently modified in the presence of bus transients, has a
   similar restriction that forces data writes to be performed in rapid
   succession. If an interval elapses, data security is re-enabled and the
   unlocking code sequence must be reissued (see ``References'' for more
   details).

   |-------------------------------------------------|
   |   configuration | Flash memory chips are        |
   |                 | self-describing using their   |
   |                 | device-code and               |
   |                 | manufacturer-code values,     |
   |                 | accessible both to a target   |
   |                 | program, and to the simulator |
   |                 | user via attributes. Since a  |
   |                 | target program may infer      |
   |                 | memory size from these        |
   |                 | values, further simulation    |
   |                 | configuration that overrides  |
   |                 | these values should be        |
   |                 | avoided unless necessary.     |
   |                 |                               |
   |                 | The device-code attribute     |
   |                 | represents the device code of |
   |                 | the flash memory part being   |
   |                 | simulated. Refer to the ATMEL |
   |                 | or AMD data sheet for a       |
   |                 | complete list of device       |
   |                 | identification codes. The     |
   |                 | manufacturer-code read-only   |
   |                 | attribute represents the      |
   |                 | manufacturer code of the      |
   |                 | flash memory. It is a         |
   |                 | constant value for ATMEL and  |
   |                 | AMD. The sector-size          |
   |                 | attribute specifies the size  |
   |                 | of an individual sector in    |
   |                 | the flash memory. Typical     |
   |                 | values are 64 to 512 bytes.   |
   |                 |                               |
   |                 | When the size attribute is    |
   |                 | written-to with a legal       |
   |                 | value, a new cleared byte     |
   |                 | array is allocated with the   |
   |                 | new size. The old byte array  |
   |                 | is thrown away. The size-max  |
   |                 | read-only attribute supplies  |
   |                 | to the user the maximum size  |
   |                 | that this component will      |
   |                 | attempt to allocate.          |
   |-----------------+-------------------------------|
   | image save/load | When the image-load pin is    |
   |                 | driven, this component will   |
   |                 | open and attempt to load the  |
   |                 | contents of the file given by |
   |                 | the image-file attribute into |
   |                 | the memory image. The file is |
   |                 | copied byte-for-byte. If the  |
   |                 | file is too short, zeroes are |
   |                 | used to fill out the rest of  |
   |                 | the memory.                   |
   |                 |                               |
   |                 | Similarly, when the           |
   |                 | image-store pin is driven,    |
   |                 | the component will write to   |
   |                 | the image-file file a         |
   |                 | byte-for-byte dump of the     |
   |                 | entire memory image.          |
   |-----------------+-------------------------------|
   | reading/writing | When an access is received on |
   |                 | the read-write-port bus, the  |
   |                 | component checks the incoming |
   |                 | address and rejects it if     |
   |                 | out-of-range. The component   |
   |                 | also rejects non-byte-sized   |
   |                 | accesses.                     |
   |                 |                               |
   |                 | Memory can be read at will,   |
   |                 | but for the AMD models, AMD's |
   |                 | protocol must be followed to  |
   |                 | put the device into byte      |
   |                 | program mode or unlock bypass |
   |                 | mode. The mode read-only      |
   |                 | attribute reveals the         |
   |                 | internal state of the device  |
   |                 | state machine. This is        |
   |                 | primarily designed for        |
   |                 | testing purposes. For AMTEL   |
   |                 | models, the data security     |
   |                 | protocol must be followed     |
   |                 | when writing to the memory -  |
   |                 | see ATMEL documentation.      |
   |-----------------+-------------------------------|
   |  memory latency | The component models the      |
   |                 | effects of memory latency.    |
   |                 | The read-latency and          |
   |                 | write-latency values specify  |
   |                 | the latencies for memory      |
   |                 | reads and writes,             |
   |                 | respectively.                 |

Environment:

   Related components
     * Customized versions of this component are available for standard
       members of the AT29 flash family. Instantiating each of them is
       equivalent to instantiating this generic component and setting the
       appropriate sector-size, size, and device-code attribute settings.

     * A flash memory will usually form a small part of the complete memory
       subsystem, providing a region of non-volatile memory. The following
       configuration file fragment demonstrates this:

         new hw-mapper-basic bus
         new hw-memory-flash-at29lv040 flash # AT29LV040: 512KB size, 512 sector-size
         connect-bus bus [0,0x7FFFF] flash read-write-port
        

   Host system

   The memory is modelled as a contiguous array of bytes in host memory. As
   such, a component configured for 8MB of memory requires 8MB of host
   memory. This is an important consideration for simulations running on
   machines with low memory or on busy multiuser systems. Similarly, when a
   memory image is written to disk, the same amount of space may be used
   there.
