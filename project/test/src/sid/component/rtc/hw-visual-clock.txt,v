@              hw-visual-clock (libtclapi.la :: tcl_bridge_library)

Synopsis:

   This is a graphical component for displaying the time given by a related
   real-time clock, such as the hw-rtc-ds1x42.

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Functionality:

  Modelling:

   This component uses a graphical clock face to represent the time stored by
   a real-time clock. This component will inter-operate with many kinds of
   real time clocks, provided they provide hour, minute and second
   attributes.

   |-------------------------------------------------|
   | window layout | The component supports resizing |
   |               | of its window. Its geometry may |
   |               | also be specified by another    |
   |               | component, in which case the    |
   |               | window will be resized          |
   |               | accordingly. The minimum        |
   |               | geometry is 150x150 and the     |
   |               | aspect ratio must be 1 to 1     |
   |               | (that is, the window must       |
   |               | remain square, so that the      |
   |               | clock face is circular).        |
   |               |                                 |
   |               | The component also allows you   |
   |               | to alter the window title via   |
   |               | the title attribute. By         |
   |               | default, the window will be     |
   |               | titled by the name of the       |
   |               | relation through which the      |
   |               | target component was            |
   |               | configured.                     |
   |---------------+---------------------------------|
   |  time display | When a related real-time clock  |
   |               | component is specified, this    |
   |               | component will periodically     |
   |               | query that component's hour,    |
   |               | minute and second attributes to |
   |               | obtain values for the clock's   |
   |               | known time. This will be shown  |
   |               | on the graphical display. If no |
   |               | related component is specified, |
   |               | the clock face will be cleared. |

   Related components

   To use this component, relate it to a real-time clock component instance
   that provides the necessary hour, minute and second attributes:

         new hw-rtc-ds1642 rtc
         [...]
         new hw-visual-clock clock-display
         relate clock-display "rtc window" rtc

    

   Because this component is written in Tk, the bridge-tk event handling pins
   must be connected for at least one Tcl/Tk/BLT component.

a3 65
* Synopsis
  This is a graphical component for displaying the time given by a
  related real-time clock, such as the hw-rtc-ds1642.

  Attributes: geometry title
  Relations: (any)

  Library: libtclapi.la
  Symbol name: tcl_bridge_library

* Functionality

  - Modelling
    * This component uses a graphical clock face to represent the time
      stored by a real-time clock.  This component will inter-operate
      with many kinds of real time clocks, provided they provide
      "hour", "minute" and "second" attributes.

  - Behaviors
    * Window layout
      The component supports resizing of its window.  Its geometry
      may also be specified by another component, in which case the
      window will be resized accordingly.  The minimum geometry is
      150x150 and the aspect ratio must be 1 to 1 (that is, the window
      must remain square, so that the clock face is circular).

      The component also allows you to alter the window title via the
      "title" attribute.  By default, the window will be titled by the
      name of the relation through which the target component was
      configured.

    * Time display
      When a related real-time clock component is specified, this
      component will periodically query that component's "hour",
      "minute" and "second" attributes to obtain values for the 
      clock's known time.  This will be shown on the graphical 
      display.  If no related component is specified, the clock face will be 
      cleared.
     
  - SID conventions

    * This is a supervisory gui component.
    * It has no state to save, and it has no use for triggerpoints.

* Environment

  - Related components
    * To use this component, relate it to a real-time clock component
      instance that provides the necessary "hour", "minute" and
      "second" attributes:

        new hw-rtc-ds1642 rtc
	[...]
        new hw-visual-clock clock-display
	relate clock-display "rtc window" rtc

    * Because this component is written in Tk, the bridge-tk event
      handling pins must be connected for at least one Tcl/Tk/BLT
      component.
