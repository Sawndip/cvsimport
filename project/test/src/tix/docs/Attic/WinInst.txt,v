                         BUILDING THE WINDOWS BINARIES

   To build Tix on Windows, you must have the following:

     * Visual C++ 4.0 or later; or Borland C++ 4.5 or later. There is not
       yet built-in support for Tix to work with other compilers.
     * The sources of Tcl/Tk for Windows.
     * The sources of Tix for Windows.

  1. DOWNLOAD THE TCL, TK AND TIX SOURCES

   You can download latest version of the Tcl7.5, 7.6 or 8.0 from
   ftp://ftp.sunlabs.com/pub . There are detailed instructions that
   comes with these packages about compiling them on Windows. Hopefully
   that will give you a good exercise on setting up the environment for
   compiling Tcl-based programs on the Windows platforms.

   You can then get the Tix source distribution at
   ftp://ftp.xpi.com/pub/Tix41.zip . This ZIP file contains files with
   long file names and must be unzipped by an UNZIP program that knows
   long filenames, such as winzip.exe.

   You should put the Tcl, Tk and Tix source packages in the same
   directory. For example, my directories look like this:

     C:\tcl7.6
     C:\tk4.2
     C:\Tix4.1

  2. COMPILE TCL AND TK

   Follow the instructions that come with Tcl and Tk. If you can compile
   successfully, you would get the following files:

     C:\tcl7.6\win\tcl76.dll
     C:\tcl7.6\win\tclpip76.dll
     C:\tk4.2\win\tk42.dll

   These are the files you need to run Tix on Windows.

  3. COMPILE TIX

   Change to the Tix4.1\Win subdirectory. Tix supports several versions
   of Tcl. You choose the version of Tcl to compile Tix with by using the
   TCL_VER variable:
     * Tcl 7.5: nmake -f makefile.vc TCL_VER=7.5
     * Tcl 7.6: nmake -f makefile.vc TCL_VER=7.6
     * Tcl 8.0: nmake -f makefile.vc TCL_VER=8.0
     * Itcl 2.2: nmake -f makefile.vc TCL_VER=2.2i

   If you have BC++, use make -f makefile.bc instead.

   When make or nmake finishes, you will get Tix binaries inside the
   build directories. For example, if you compile Tix for Tcl 7.6, you
   will be the following files: 

     C:\Tix4.1\win\tcl7.6\tix4176.dll
     C:\Tix4.1\win\tcl7.6\tix4176.exe

   The executable file tix4176.exe contains Tcl, Tk and Tix. You can use
   it to run an Tix script by: 

     set TIX_LIBRARY=C:\Tix4.1\library C:\Tix4.1\win\tcl7.6\tix4176.exe
     foo.tcl

  4. FIXING DLL PROBLEMS

   You may run into certain problems related to DLL's when you execute
   tix4176.exe. For example:
     * Windows complains that a DLL, usually tcl76.dll, is not found.
     * Windows complains that a symbol is missing.
     * Some weird things happen.

   When tix4176.exe starts up, it will load in the following DLL's
     * tcl76.dll
     * tclpip76.dll
     * tk42.dll
     * tix4176.dll

   Windows searches for a DLL file by the following order:
    1. Same directory as executable.
    2. Windows system directory.
    3. directories in the PATH environment variable.

   To ensure that the correct DLLs are loaded, you can copy all the DLL's
   used by tix4176.exe into the directory where tix4176.exe is.

  5. INSTALLING TIX

   You can install Tix into the Tcl installation directory so that you
   can load Tix with the "package require" command and no longer need to
   set the TIX_LIBRARY variable:

    1. Create a directory tix4.1 under the Tcl installation directory,
       usually in C:\Program Files\Tcl7.6\lib.

    2. Copy all the files under Tix4.1b1\library into the C:\Program
       Files\Tcl7.6\lib\tix4.1 directory.

    3. Copy the file Tix4.1\win\pkgIndex.tcl into the C:\Program
       Files\Tcl7.6\lib\tix4.1 directory.

   Now you should be able to start up wish42.exe and execute the
   following command to load in Tix. 

     package require -exact Tix [tixBinVer 4.1] 

   Read the file Tix4.1\docs\Pkg.txt for more info about dynamically
   loading Tix.

  FAQ'S FOR RUNNING TIX ON WINDOWS

   How do I set an environment variable.

          You can set it in your DOS window by typing something like "set
          TIX_LIBRARY=C:\Tix4.1\win". This will affect that particular
          DOS window only. If you want the change to affect the whole
          Windows environment (for example, you want launch txwish41.exe
          by double-clicking on its icon), you must put the commands in
          your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and then reboot your machine.

   I get an "out of environment space" error from DOS.

          Edit your CONFIG.SYS file and add the switch "/E:1024" to the
          SHELL=COMMAND.COM line. Reboot. This should give you enough
          env space.

   My C compiler says "unrecognized file format tk42.lib" or something
          like that.

          You compiled tk42.lib with VC++ and are compiling Tix with
          Borland C++, or vice verse. Use the same compiler to compile
          all binaries.
