  TIX 4.1A3

   Released on April 23, 1996

Subject: [Announce] Tix version 4.1a3 is available

   I am pleased to announce the availability of Tix version 4.1a3, the
   third alpha release. This version of Tix supports the Unix and
   Microsoft Windows platforms.

   Tix 4.1 is the commercial version of Tix 4.0. It contains more widgets
   and works under MS Windows. Please read the file license.terms first
   inside the distribution tar file or from the WWW at
   http://www.xpi.com/tix/license.terms.41a3.txt 

  REQUIREMENT

    Unix Platforms

   Tix 4.1a3 works with the following combinations of Tcl/Tk/ITcl/ET:
     * Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0
     * Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0 + ITcl 2.0
     * Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0 + ET 1.5
     * Tcl 7.5 + Tk 4.1 (final release only)

    Windows Platforms

   Tix 4.1a3 requires the final release of Tcl 7.5 and Tk 4.1 (no alpha
   or beta versions). Many things currently does not work under Windows,
   including:
     * FileSelectDialog (ExFileSelectDialog does work, though)
     * The top-left corner of the Grid (aka spreadsheet) widget
     * XPM images

  GETTING THE TIX PACKAGE

   Tix 4.1a3 is available at
     * ftp://ftp.xpi.com/pub/Tix4.1a3.tar.gz: Unix source tar file.
     * ftp://ftp.xpi.com/pub/windows/tix41a3.zip: Same as
       Tix4.1a3.tar.gz, but in Windows/DOS ZIP format.
     * ftp://ftp.xpi.com/pub/windows/tix41bin.zip: Windows binaries.

  WHAT'S NEW SINCE TIX 4.1A2 (THE LAST RELEASE)

    5/5/96

   New feature: New tool unix-et-tk4.0/makescript.tcl. It includes the
   Tix script library into a ET application in the correct order. If
   A.tcl depends on B.tcl, then B.tcl is loaded first.

    5/6/96

   New feature: Now the -default option of the Tix mega widget classes
   are inherited from their superclasses.

   New feature: New option -expand for the panes in PanedWindow

   Bug Fixed: ScrolledHList didn't calculate the size of the hlist
   subwidget correctly, resulting in scrollbars not appearing even if the
   hlist widget is not big enough to display all of its contents.

    5/8/96

   New feature: New method setsize for PanedWindow.

    5/10/96

   New feature: New widget tixMeter, can be used to display the progress
   of work.

   Bug Fixed: HList multiple and extended selectMode now work with
   TixTree.

    5/11/96

   Bug Fixed: HList "see" method sometimes doesn't display the specified
   element correctly.

   New widgets: New widgets CheckList, Grid, ScrolledGrid, TList and
   ScrolledTList added to the Tix 4.1 distribution.

   New feature: New option -postcmd for PopupMenu widget.
