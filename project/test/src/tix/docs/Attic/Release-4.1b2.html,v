@<h3>Tix 4.1b2</h3>
<i> Released on December 28, 1996</i> <p>

<pre>

Subject: [Announce] Tix version 4.1b2 is available

</pre>

   I am pleased to announce the availability of Tix version 4.1b2, the
   first beta release. This version of Tix supports the Unix and
   Microsoft Windows platforms. <p>

   The Tix library has by far the greatest collection of widgets for
   programming with Tcl/Tk. Highlights include: Hierarchical Listbox,
   Directory List/Tree View, SpreadSheet, Tabular Listbox, ComboBox,
   Motif style FileSelectBox, MS Windows style FileSelectBox,
   PanedWindow, NoteBook, Spin Control widget .... and many more. With
   these new widgets, your Tcl/Tk applications will look great and
   interact with your users in intuitive ways. <p>

   For more info about Tix, visit the Tix home page at <a
   href="http://www.xpi.com/tix/"> http://www.xpi.com/tix/ </a>. <p>

   This version of Tix is released under licensing terms similar to
   those of Tcl/Tk. Please read the file license.terms carefully
   before proceeding. <p>

<h3>Requirement</h3>

<h4>Unix Platforms</h4>
   
   Tix 4.1b2 works with the following combinations of Tcl/Tk/ITcl:
   <ul>
     <li> Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0 
     <li> Tcl 7.4 + Tk 4.0 + ITcl 2.0
     <li> Tcl 7.5 + Tk 4.1
     <li> Tcl 7.5 + Tk 4.1 + ITcl 2.1
     <li> Tcl 7.6 + Tk 4.2
   </ul>

<h4>Windows Platforms</h4>

   Tix 4.1b2 requires the final release of Tcl 7.5 or Tcl 7.6.

<h3>Getting The Tix Package</h3>

   Tix 4.1b2 sources are available at
   <ul>
     <li> <a href="ftp://ftp.xpi.com/pub/Tix4.1b2.tar.gz">
	  ftp://ftp.xpi.com/pub/Tix4.1b2.tar.gz</a>: Unix source tar file.

     <li> <a href="ftp://ftp.xpi.com/pub/windows/tix41b2.zip">
	  ftp://ftp.xpi.com/pub/windows/tix41b2.zip</a>: Same as
	  Tix4.1b2.tar.gz, but in Windows/DOS ZIP format.
   </ul>

<h3>What's New Since Tix 4.1a3 (the last release)</h3>


<h4>10/13/96</h4>

  <b>New feature:</b> Now XPM image works on Windows. <p>

<h4>10/18/96</h4>

  <b>New feature:</b> New options -editnotifycmd and -editdonecmd for
  the Grid widget to support editing of the entries. <p>

  <b>New feature:</b> New widget <b>TixFloatEntry</b> to support
  editing of DItems. <p>

<h4>10/27/96</h4>

  <b>Feature Change:</b> The following changes are made to the
  configuration and installation of Tix:
  <ul>

    <li> <b>Naming convention of binaries</b>: The binaries for the
	 Tk 4.0 target are called tixwish and libtix.a. For Tk 4.1 and
	 later, the executable is be called tixwish[Tix version].[Tk version]
	 and the library is called libtix[Tix version].[Tk
	 version].[lib extension]. For example, tixwish4.1.4.1 and
	 libtix4.1.4.2.so. On platforms that do not allow the dot
	 character in the names of shared libraries, the dot character
	 will be omitted. E.g., libtix4142.so.

    <li> <b>Shared vs static linking</b>: The static binary will be
	 created only if the -enable-[tkversion]-shared flag is
	 disabled. If you want to create both shared and static
	 binaries, configure and compile Tix twice.

    <li> ET support is replaced by SAM (stand-alone module)
	 support.

    <li> The following options are removed from configure:
	 <ul>
	   <li> -enable-tk40_et
	   <li> -enable-tk41_et
	   <li> -enable-tk41_shared
	 </ul>	 

    <li> The new options are added to configure:
	 <ul>
	   <li> -enable-tk40-sam
	   <li> -enable-tk41-sam
	   <li> -enable-tk42-sam
	   <li> -enable-tk41-shared
	   <li> -enable-tk42-shared
	 </ul>	 
  </ul>


<h4>11/1/96</h4>

  <b>New feature:</b> XPM code has been rewritten. The code is now cleanly
  separated into three modules: generic, windows specific and Unix specific.
  <p>

  
<h4>11/17/96</h4>

  <b>New feature:</b> Tix classes can be defined before their
  superclasses are defined. However, a class <b>cannot</b> be
  instantiated before all of its superclasses are defined. This
  feature makes it possible to load the Tix scripts into the SAM in
  any order, without having to worry about loading the superclasses
  before the subclasses. <p>
  
  <b>New feature:</b> Tix is initialized by calling the command
  <b>__tixInit</b>, not by sourcing <b>Init.tcl</b>. <p>
  
<h4>11/29/96</h4>

  <b>Bug Fixed:</b> tixTmpLine now correctly works on multiple X
  displays. <p>

<h4>11/30/96</h4>

  <b>Feature Change</b>: DisplayStyle now uses a hash table to store
  the items associated with it (previously a link list was used). This
  speeds up the delete operations when a lot (1000 or more) of items
  are associated with the same style. <b>Possible Incompatibility:</b>
  widgets that use DItems must be recompiled. <p>

  <b>Bug Fixed:</b> Tix no longer tempers with the way Tk handles
  errors, unless the environment variable TIX_DEBUG_INTERACTIVE is
  set. If this variable is set, all error messages will be printed to
  the standard output. This may be convenient for debugging
  purposes. Use this feature with discretion, and during program
  development only. <p>

<h4>12/2/96</h4>

  <b>Bug Fixed:</b>Dotted anchor lines (HList, TList, Grid) and
  rubber-band lines (PanedWindow, ResizeHandle) are implemented on Windows.<p>

  <b>New feature:</b> Tcl 7.6 support is complete for the Windows
  platform. makefile.vc and makefile.bc have been modified such that
  the Tcl version can be chosen at compile time by, e.g., "<b>make
  TCL_VER=7.5 -f makefile.bc</b>". <p>
  
<h4>12/2/96</h4>
  
  <b>Bug Fixed:</b> Display items are correctly clipped. E.g., if a
  text item is wider than the width of a column in an HList, the item
  will be clipped.<p>

<h4>12/20/96</h4>

  <b>New feature:</b> New sample file demos/samples/EditGrid.tcl that
  demonstrates the use of an editable grid widget. <p>

<h4>12/21/96</h4>
  
  <b>Bug Fixed:</b> Tix works with multiple interpreters under tk4.1
  and 4.2 (see test/general/minterp.tcl). However, minterp.tcl still
  core dumps under Itcl 2.1. It is not clear to me whether this is a
  problem of Tix or Itcl. <p>

  <b>Bug Fixed:</b> Now when an interpreter is deleted, all Tix class
  informations associated with this interpreter are freed. (No memory
  leak is recorded by purify when running Tix against the complete
  test suite.) <p>
