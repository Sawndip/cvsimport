@/* 
 * Demo.c --
 *
 *	Demonstrates how to create a Windows DLL that uses Tcl/Tk and
 *	(optionally) Tix.
 *
 *	A Windows DLL for Tcl/TK must have three functions. Two of them
 *      are DLL Entry Points, required by Windows and are called when
 *	the DLL is loaded into Windows. The third one is a function
 *	called <Pkg>_Init, which is called when the DLL is loaded into
 *	tclsh.exe or wish.exe via the "load" command.
 *
 * DLL Entry Points:
 *
 *	For the two DLL entry points, actually only one of them is called,
 *	depending which compiler you are using. If you use VC++, you should
 *	define the function DllMain. If you use Borland C++, you should
 *	define the function DllEntryPoint. In this file, we just define
 *	both of them so that this file can be happily compiled under
 *	both compilers. We will just make DllEntryPoint to call DllMain(),
 *	which should carry any initialization actions required. In most
 *	cases, however, we wouldn't do any initialization and just return
 *	TRUE.
 *
 * <Pkg>_Init function
 *
 *	You must have a function called <Pkg>_Init, where <Pkg> is the name
 *	of your package. In our case, we name the package "Demo" so the
 *	function is Demo_Init(). It should just do the normal sort of
 *	initializations required by a Tcl extension (create commands,
 *	variables, etc). In our example, we create a command called
 *	"demoHello" which just returns the string "Hello Tcl/Tk World".
 *
 * Linking to the C language API of Tix
 *
 *	Nothing special needs to be done. You have to make sure the Tix
 *	header files are in the INCLUDE directories and like against Tix41.lib
 *	when you create your DLL. See the "demo_tix.dll" target in
 *	the makefile.bc
