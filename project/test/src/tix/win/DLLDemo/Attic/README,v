@(0) Introduction:

    The files in this directory demonstrates how to create a Win32 DLL
    for Tcl/TK. It creates a file called DEMO.DLL which can be loaded
    into wish41.exe via the "load" command.

    The Borland C++ makefile (Makefile.bc) and a C file (Demo.c) gives
    an example for all the steps that you need to take to create such a
    DLL to load under Tcl/Tk. Moreover, if you are using Tix and need to
    call the Tix C functions in your DLL, please refer to the Makefile.bc
    for the necessary compilation flags required.

(1) Requirement:

    Tcl/Tk sources are required. You can download them from

	ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/tcl75b3.zip
	ftp://ftp.smli.com/pub/tcl/tk41b3.zip

    Tix sources are required in you need to compile against Tix.DLL. It
    can be downloaded from

	ftp://ftp.xpi.com/pub/windows/tix41a2.zip

(2) Compilation:

    (a) You must compile the Tcl/Tk sources first. The reason is we
	need the files tcl75.lib and tk41.lib, which are not released
	by Sun in their binary release. This is also a good exercise
	for you to set up your environment for compiling Tcl/Tk-based
	software.

	If you have BC++ (4.5 or later) installed on your system, edit
	the header part of the file tcl7.5b3\win\makefile.bc to reflect
	the settings in your environment. Then

	    cd tcl7.5b3\win\
	    make -f makefile.bc

	When this finishes, you will get tcl75.dll and tcl75.lib in this
	directory.

	Do the same things to get tk41.dll and tk41.lib

    (b) Now cd to the DLLDemo directory and edit the file makefile.bc to
	to reflect the settings in your environment. Don't worry about the
	setting of the TIX directories yet.

        Now type

	    make -f makefile.bc

	in this directory. When this is done, you should get a demo.dll. Start
	up wish41.exe. When you get the console screen, type the following
	in it:

	    load demo.dll
	    puts [demoHello]

    (c) If your DLL doesn't need to call the C functions of Tix (like our
	demo.dll), you can stop here. If you need to call the Tix C functions,
	then first install the Tix sources and get tix41.lib and tix41.dll.
	then change back to the DLLDemo directory and type

	    make -f makefile.bc tix

	This will compile a demo_tix.dll that is linked to tix41.dll, tk41.dll
	and tcl75.dll.
