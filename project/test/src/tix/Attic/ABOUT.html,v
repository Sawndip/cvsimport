<TITLE>About the Tix Programming Library</TITLE>

   The Tix library is an extension to the Tk toolkit that contains
   over 40 new widgets for Tk. Features include:

   <DL>
     <DT><b>A LOT of new widgets:</b>
     <DD>

	  The Tix library has by far the greatest collection of
	  widgets for programming with Tcl/Tk. Highlights include:
	  Hierarchical Listbox, Directory List/Tree View, SpreadSheet,
	  Tabular Listbox, ComboBox, Motif style FileSelectBox, MS
	  Windows style FileSelectBox, PanedWindow, NoteBook, Spin
	  Control widget .... and many more. With these new widgets,
	  your applications will look great and interact with your
	  users in intuitive ways.

     <DT><b>Rapid Prototyping New Widgets:</b>
     <DD>

	  Tix comes with a complete Object-Oriented framework for
	  building new customed widgets using TCL exclusively. It
	  typically reduces the efforts of developing a new widget by
	  a factor of ten or more.<p>

     <DT> <b>XPM image suport:</b>
     <DD>  

	  This allows you to display color icons in XPM
	  format. Supports transparent background. <p>
	  
     <DT><b>Compound images:</b>
     <DD>

	  A new image type called "compound" allows youto glue
	  together a bunch of bitmaps, images and text strings
	  together to form a bigger image. Then you can use this image
	  with widgets that support the -image option. For example,
	  you can display a text string string together with a bitmap,
	  at the same time, inside a TK button widget.<p>

     <DT><b> Display Items and Display Styles:</b>
     <DD>

	  Display items and display styles make it possible to display
	  visual information in many formats.<p>
	  
     <DT><b>Form geometry manager:</b>
     <DD>

	  Works similarly to the Motif Form widget. You can specify
	  geometry constraints using attachment rules.  <p>
	  
     <DT><b> Mwm window mamager support:</b>
     <DD>

	  With the <code>tixMwm</code> command, you can communicate
	  with the Motif window manager "mwm"; you can add new items
	  to the Motif system menu and change the window manager
	  decorations.<p>
