@# Tix Demostration Program
#
# This sample program is structured in such a way so that it can be
# executed from the Tix demo program "widget": it must have a
# procedure called "RunSample". It should also have the "if" statment
# at the end of this file so that it can be run as a standalone
# program using tixwish.

# This file demonstrates the use of the tixPanedWindow widget. This program
# is a dummy news reader: the user can adjust the sizes of the list
# of artical names and the size of the text widget that shows the body
# of the artical
#

Lines 353       A new way to put text and bitmaps together iNo responses

Hi,

I have implemented a new image type called "compound". It allows you
to glue together a bunch of bitmaps, images and text strings together
to form a bigger image. Then you can use this image with widgets that
support the -image option. This way you can display very fancy stuffs
in your GUI. For example, you can display a text string string
together with a bitmap, at the same time, inside a TK button widget. A
screenshot of compound images can be found at the bottom of this page:

        http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~ioi/tix/screenshot.html

You can also you is in other places such as putting fancy bitmap+text
in menus, tabs of tixNoteBook widgets, etc. This feature will be
included in the next release of Tix (4.0b1). Count on it to make jazzy
interfaces!}

# This "if" statement makes it possible to run this script file inside or
# outside of the main demo program "widget".
#
if {![info exists tix_demo_running]} {
    wm withdraw .
    set w .demo
    toplevel $w
    RunSample $w
	bind $w <Destroy> {if {"%W" == ".demo"} exit}
}
