@This set of patches add support for aout emulation on the x86
assembler.  ie. You will be able to do "as --em=i386aout" on an x86
linux-elf assembler to generate aout format object files, rather than
using a separate assembler.  The aout emulation is enabled by giving
"--enable-targets=i386-linuxaout" to configure.
Oh yeah, there's a couple of fixes too.  Error messages shouldn't be
passed to printf in the format arg just in case someone puts a `%' in
the message.
