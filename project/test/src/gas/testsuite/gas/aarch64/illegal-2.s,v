@Added missing alignment check to load/store uimm12 immediate offset.

opcodes/

* aarch64-opc.c (operand_general_constraint_met_p): Change to check
the alignment of addr.offset.imm instead of that of shifter.amount for
operand type AARCH64_OPND_ADDR_UIMM12.

gas/testsuite/

* gas/aarch64/illegal-2.s: Add test case.
* gas/aarch64/illegal-2.l: Likewise.

@// illegal-2.s Test file for AArch64 instructions that should be rejected
// by the assembler.  This test is a complement to the illegal.s test.
// md_apply_fix will not run if there is any error occurred in an earlier
// stage, which means errors should be reported by md_apply_fix will not
// be issued.  This test hosts instructions that will only incur error
// report from md_apply_fix.
