        * lib/gas-defs.exp (run_dump_test): Support new attribute "stderr"
        which is a file used to regexp_diff the assembler's pruned stderr
        output.
        (write_file): New helper function to write a string into a file.

        * gas/mips/empic.l: New file which matches empic tests' warnings.
        * gas/mips/empic.d: Use empic.l.
