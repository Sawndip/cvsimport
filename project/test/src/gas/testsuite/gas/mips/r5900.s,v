log
@	* archures.c: Add support for MIPS r5900
	* bfd-in2.h: Add support for MIPS r5900
	* config.bfd: Add support for Sony Playstation 2
	* cpu-mips.c: Add support for MIPS r5900
	* elfxx-mips.c: Add support for MIPS r5900 (extension of r4000)

	* config/tc-mips.c: Add support for MIPS r5900
	Add M_LQ_AB and M_SQ_AB to support large values for instructions lq and sq.
	* config/tc-mips.c (can_swap_branch_p, get_append_method): Detect some conditional short loops to fix a bug on the r5900 by NOP in the branch delay slot.
	* config/tc-mips.c (M_MUL): Support 3 operands in multu on r5900.
	* config/tc-mips.c (M_TRUNCWS): Support trunc.w.s on r5900 in MIPS ISA I.
	* config/tc-mips.c (s_mipsset): Force 32 bit floating point on r5900.
	* configure.in: Detect CPU type when target string contains r5900 (e.g. mips64r5900el-linux-gnu).

	* config/tc-mips.c (mips_ip): Check parameter range of instructions mfps and mtps on r5900.

	* elf/mips.h: Add MIPS machine variant number for r5900 which is compatible with old Playstation 2 software.
	* opcode/mips.h: Add support for r5900 instructions including lq and sq.

	* configure.tgt: Support ELF files for Sony Playstation 2 (for ps2dev and ps2sdk).
	* emulparams/elf32lr5900n32.sh: Create linker script for Sony Playstation 2 ELF files using MIPS ABI n32.
	* emulparams/elf32lr5900.sh: Create linker script for Sony Playstation 2 ELF files using MIPS ABI o32.
	* Makefile.am: Add linker scripts for Sony Playstation 2 ELF files.

	* opcodes/mips-dis.c: Add names for CP0 registers of r5900.
	* opcodes/mips-opc.c: Add M_SQ_AB and M_LQ_AB to support larger range for instructions sq and lq.

	* opcodes/mips-opc.c: Add support for MIPS r5900 CPU.
	Add support for 128 bit MMI (Multimedia Instructions).
	Add support for EE instructions (Emotion Engine).
	Disable unsupported floating point instructions (64 bit and undefined compare operations).
	Enable instructions of MIPS ISA IV which are supported by r5900.
	Disable 64 bit co processor instructions.
	Disable 64 bit multiplication and division instructions.
	Disable instructions for co-processor 2 and 3, because these are not supported (preparation for later VU0 support (Vector Unit)).
	Disable cvt.w.s because this behaves like trunc.w.s and the correct execution can't be ensured on r5900.
	Add trunc.w.s using the opcode encoding of cvt.w.s on r5900. This will confuse less developers and compilers.
