Opcodes
-------

   For detailed information on the SH64 machine instruction set, see
`SuperH 64 bit RISC Series Architecture Manual' (SuperH, Inc.).

   `as' implements all the standard SH64 opcodes.  In addition, the
following pseudo-opcodes may be expanded into one or more alternate
opcodes:

`movi'
     If the value doesn't fit into a standard `movi' opcode, `as' will
     replace the `movi' with a sequence of `movi' and `shori' opcodes.

`pt'
     This expands to a sequence of `movi' and `shori' opcode, followed
     by a `ptrel' opcode, or to a `pta' or `ptb' opcode, depending on
     the label referenced.

Options
-------

   The SPARC chip family includes several successive levels, using the
same core instruction set, but including a few additional instructions
at each level.  There are exceptions to this however.  For details on
what instructions each variant supports, please see the chip's
architecture reference manual.

   By default, `as' assumes the core instruction set (SPARC v6), but
"bumps" the architecture level as needed: it switches to successively
higher architectures as it encounters instructions that only exist in
the higher levels.

   If not configured for SPARC v9 (`sparc64-*-*') GAS will not bump
passed sparclite by default, an option must be passed to enable the v9
instructions.

   GAS treats sparclite as being compatible with v8, unless an
architecture is explicitly requested.  SPARC v9 is always incompatible
with sparclite.

`-Av6 | -Av7 | -Av8 | -Asparclet | -Asparclite'
`-Av8plus | -Av8plusa | -Av9 | -Av9a'
     Use one of the `-A' options to select one of the SPARC
     architectures explicitly.  If you select an architecture
     explicitly, `as' reports a fatal error if it encounters an
     instruction or feature requiring an incompatible or higher level.

     `-Av8plus' and `-Av8plusa' select a 32 bit environment.

     `-Av9' and `-Av9a' select a 64 bit environment and are not
     available unless GAS is explicitly configured with 64 bit
     environment support.

     `-Av8plusa' and `-Av9a' enable the SPARC V9 instruction set with
     UltraSPARC extensions.

`-xarch=v8plus | -xarch=v8plusa'
     For compatibility with the Solaris v9 assembler.  These options are
     equivalent to -Av8plus and -Av8plusa, respectively.

`-bump'
     Warn whenever it is necessary to switch to another level.  If an
     architecture level is explicitly requested, GAS will not issue
     warnings until that level is reached, and will then bump the level
     as required (except between incompatible levels).

`-32 | -64'
     Select the word size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.  These options
     are only available with the ELF object file format, and require
     that the necessary BFD support has been included.

Enforcing aligned data
----------------------

   SPARC GAS normally permits data to be misaligned.  For example, it
permits the `.long' pseudo-op to be used on a byte boundary.  However,
the native SunOS and Solaris assemblers issue an error when they see
misaligned data.

   You can use the `--enforce-aligned-data' option to make SPARC GAS
also issue an error about misaligned data, just as the SunOS and Solaris
assemblers do.

   The `--enforce-aligned-data' option is not the default because gcc
issues misaligned data pseudo-ops when it initializes certain packed
data structures (structures defined using the `packed' attribute).  You
may have to assemble with GAS in order to initialize packed data
structures in your own code.

Floating Point
--------------

   The Sparc uses IEEE floating-point numbers.


File: as.info,  Node: Sparc-Directives,  Prev: Sparc-Float,  Up: Sparc-Dependent

Sparc Machine Directives
------------------------

   The Sparc version of `as' supports the following additional machine
directives:

`.align'
     This must be followed by the desired alignment in bytes.

`.common'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.comm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.half'
     This is functionally identical to `.short'.

`.nword'
     On the Sparc, the `.nword' directive produces native word sized
     value, ie. if assembling with -32 it is equivalent to `.word', if
     assembling with -64 it is equivalent to `.xword'.

`.proc'
     This directive is ignored.  Any text following it on the same line
     is also ignored.

`.register'
     This directive declares use of a global application or system
     register.  It must be followed by a register name %g2, %g3, %g6 or
     %g7, comma and the symbol name for that register.  If symbol name
     is `#scratch', it is a scratch register, if it is `#ignore', it
     just suppresses any errors about using undeclared global register,
     but does not emit any information about it into the object file.
     This can be useful e.g. if you save the register before use and
     restore it after.

`.reserve'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.lcomm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.seg'
     This must be followed by `"text"', `"data"', or `"data1"'.  It
     behaves like `.text', `.data', or `.data 1'.

`.skip'
     This is functionally identical to the `.space' directive.

`.word'
     On the Sparc, the `.word' directive produces 32 bit values,
     instead of the 16 bit values it produces on many other machines.

`.xword'
     On the Sparc V9 processor, the `.xword' directive produces 64 bit
     values.

Options
-------

   The TMS320C54x version of `as' has a few machine-dependent options.

   You can use the `-mfar-mode' option to enable extended addressing
mode.  All addresses will be assumed to be > 16 bits, and the
appropriate relocation types will be used.  This option is equivalent
to using the `.far_mode' directive in the assembly code.  If you do not
use the `-mfar-mode' option, all references will be assumed to be 16
bits.  This option may be abbreviated to `-mf'.

   You can use the `-mcpu' option to specify a particular CPU.  This
option is equivalent to using the `.version' directive in the assembly
code.  For recognized CPU codes, see *Note `.version':
TIC54X-Directives.  The default CPU version is `542'.

   You can use the `-merrors-to-file' option to redirect error output
to a file (this provided for those deficient environments which don't
provide adequate output redirection).  This option may be abbreviated to
`-me'.

Blocking
--------

   A blocked section or memory block is guaranteed not to cross the
blocking boundary (usually a page, or 128 words) if it is smaller than
the blocking size, or to start on a page boundary if it is larger than
the blocking size.

Environment Settings
--------------------

   `C54XDSP_DIR' and `A_DIR' are semicolon-separated paths which are
added to the list of directories normally searched for source and
include files.  `C54XDSP_DIR' will override `A_DIR'.

Constants Syntax
----------------

   The TIC54X version of `as' allows the following additional constant
formats, using a suffix to indicate the radix:

     Binary                  `000000B, 011000b'
     Octal                   `10Q, 224q'
     Hexadecimal             `45h, 0FH'


File: as.info,  Node: TIC54X-Subsyms,  Next: TIC54X-Locals,  Prev: TIC54X-Constants,  Up: TIC54X-Dependent

String Substitution
-------------------

   A subset of allowable symbols (which we'll call subsyms) may be
assigned arbitrary string values.  This is roughly equivalent to C
preprocessor #define macros.  When `as' encounters one of these
symbols, the symbol is replaced in the input stream by its string value.
Subsym names *must* begin with a letter.

   Subsyms may be defined using the `.asg' and `.eval' directives
(*Note `.asg': TIC54X-Directives, *Note `.eval': TIC54X-Directives.

   Expansion is recursive until a previously encountered symbol is
seen, at which point substitution stops.

   In this example, x is replaced with SYM2; SYM2 is replaced with
SYM1, and SYM1 is replaced with x.  At this point, x has already been
encountered and the substitution stops.

      .asg   "x",SYM1
      .asg   "SYM1",SYM2
      .asg   "SYM2",x
      add    x,a             ; final code assembled is "add  x, a"

   Macro parameters are converted to subsyms; a side effect of this is
the normal `as' '\ARG' dereferencing syntax is unnecessary.  Subsyms
defined within a macro will have global scope, unless the `.var'
directive is used to identify the subsym as a local macro variable
*note `.var': TIC54X-Directives..

   Substitution may be forced in situations where replacement might be
ambiguous by placing colons on either side of the subsym.  The following
code:

      .eval  "10",x
     LAB:X:  add     #x, a

   When assembled becomes:

     LAB10  add     #10, a

   Smaller parts of the string assigned to a subsym may be accessed with
the following syntax:

``:SYMBOL(CHAR_INDEX):''
     Evaluates to a single-character string, the character at
     CHAR_INDEX.

``:SYMBOL(START,LENGTH):''
     Evaluates to a substring of SYMBOL beginning at START with length
     LENGTH.

Local Labels
------------

   Local labels may be defined in two ways:

   * $N, where N is a decimal number between 0 and 9

   * LABEL?, where LABEL is any legal symbol name.

   Local labels thus defined may be redefined or automatically
generated.  The scope of a local label is based on when it may be
undefined or reset.  This happens when one of the following situations
is encountered:

   * .newblock directive *note `.newblock': TIC54X-Directives.

   * The current section is changed (.sect, .text, or .data)

   * Entering or leaving an included file

   * The macro scope where the label was defined is exited

Extended Addressing
-------------------

   The `LDX' pseudo-op is provided for loading the extended addressing
bits of a label or address.  For example, if an address `_label' resides
in extended program memory, the value of `_label' may be loaded as
follows:
      ldx     #_label,16,a    ; loads extended bits of _label
      or      #_label,a       ; loads lower 16 bits of _label
      bacc    a               ; full address is in accumulator A


File: as.info,  Node: TIC54X-Directives,  Next: TIC54X-Macros,  Prev: TIC54X-Ext,  Up: TIC54X-Dependent

Directives
----------

`.align [SIZE]'
`.even'
     Align the section program counter on the next boundary, based on
     SIZE.  SIZE may be any power of 2.  `.even' is equivalent to
     `.align' with a SIZE of 2.
    `1'
          Align SPC to word boundary

    `2'
          Align SPC to longword boundary (same as .even)

    `128'
          Align SPC to page boundary

`.asg STRING, NAME'
     Assign NAME the string STRING.  String replacement is performed on
     STRING before assignment.

`.eval STRING, NAME'
     Evaluate the contents of string STRING and assign the result as a
     string to the subsym NAME.  String replacement is performed on
     STRING before assignment.

`.bss SYMBOL, SIZE [, [BLOCKING_FLAG] [,ALIGNMENT_FLAG]]'
     Reserve space for SYMBOL in the .bss section.  SIZE is in words.
     If present, BLOCKING_FLAG indicates the allocated space should be
     aligned on a page boundary if it would otherwise cross a page
     boundary.  If present, ALIGNMENT_FLAG causes the assembler to
     allocate SIZE on a long word boundary.

`.byte VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ubyte VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.char VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uchar VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more bytes into consecutive words of the current
     section.  The upper 8 bits of each word is zero-filled.  If a
     label is used, it points to the word allocated for the first byte
     encountered.

`.clink ["SECTION_NAME"]'
     Set STYP_CLINK flag for this section, which indicates to the
     linker that if no symbols from this section are referenced, the
     section should not be included in the link.  If SECTION_NAME is
     omitted, the current section is used.

`.c_mode'
     TBD.

`.copy "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
`.include "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
     Read source statements from FILENAME.  The normal include search
     path is used.  Normally .copy will cause statements from the
     included file to be printed in the assembly listing and .include
     will not, but this distinction is not currently implemented.

`.data'
     Begin assembling code into the .data section.

`.double VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ldouble VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.float VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.xfloat VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place an IEEE single-precision floating-point representation of
     one or more floating-point values into the current section.  All
     but `.xfloat' align the result on a longword boundary.  Values are
     stored most-significant word first.

`.drlist'
`.drnolist'
     Control printing of directives to the listing file.  Ignored.

`.emsg STRING'
`.mmsg STRING'
`.wmsg STRING'
     Emit a user-defined error, message, or warning, respectively.

`.far_mode'
     Use extended addressing when assembling statements.  This should
     appear only once per file, and is equivalent to the -mfar-mode
     option *note `-mfar-mode': TIC54X-Opts..

`.fclist'
`.fcnolist'
     Control printing of false conditional blocks to the listing file.

`.field VALUE [,SIZE]'
     Initialize a bitfield of SIZE bits in the current section.  If
     VALUE is relocatable, then SIZE must be 16.  SIZE defaults to 16
     bits.  If VALUE does not fit into SIZE bits, the value will be
     truncated.  Successive `.field' directives will pack starting at
     the current word, filling the most significant bits first, and
     aligning to the start of the next word if the field size does not
     fit into the space remaining in the current word.  A `.align'
     directive with an operand of 1 will force the next `.field'
     directive to begin packing into a new word.  If a label is used, it
     points to the word that contains the specified field.

`.global SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
`.def SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
`.ref SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
     `.def' nominally identifies a symbol defined in the current file
     and availalbe to other files.  `.ref' identifies a symbol used in
     the current file but defined elsewhere.  Both map to the standard
     `.global' directive.

`.half VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uhalf VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.short VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ushort VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.int VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uint VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.word VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uword VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more values into consecutive words of the current
     section.  If a label is used, it points to the word allocated for
     the first value encountered.

`.label SYMBOL'
     Define a special SYMBOL to refer to the load time address of the
     current section program counter.

`.length'
`.width'
     Set the page length and width of the output listing file.  Ignored.

`.list'
`.nolist'
     Control whether the source listing is printed.  Ignored.

`.long VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ulong VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.xlong VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more 32-bit values into consecutive words in the
     current section.  The most significant word is stored first.
     `.long' and `.ulong' align the result on a longword boundary;
     `xlong' does not.

`.loop [COUNT]'
`.break [CONDITION]'
`.endloop'
     Repeatedly assemble a block of code.  `.loop' begins the block, and
     `.endloop' marks its termination.  COUNT defaults to 1024, and
     indicates the number of times the block should be repeated.
     `.break' terminates the loop so that assembly begins after the
     `.endloop' directive.  The optional CONDITION will cause the loop
     to terminate only if it evaluates to zero.

`MACRO_NAME .macro [PARAM1][,...PARAM_N]'
`[.mexit]'
`.endm'
     See the section on macros for more explanation (*Note
     TIC54X-Macros::.

`.mlib "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
     Load the macro library FILENAME.  FILENAME must be an archived
     library (BFD ar-compatible) of text files, expected to contain
     only macro definitions.   The standard include search path is used.

`.mlist'

`.mnolist'
     Control whether to include macro and loop block expansions in the
     listing output.  Ignored.

`.mmregs'
     Define global symbolic names for the 'c54x registers.  Supposedly
     equivalent to executing `.set' directives for each register with
     its memory-mapped value, but in reality is provided only for
     compatibility and does nothing.

`.newblock'
     This directive resets any TIC54X local labels currently defined.
     Normal `as' local labels are unaffected.

`.option OPTION_LIST'
     Set listing options.  Ignored.

`.sblock "SECTION_NAME" | SECTION_NAME [,"NAME_N" | NAME_N]'
     Designate SECTION_NAME for blocking.  Blocking guarantees that a
     section will start on a page boundary (128 words) if it would
     otherwise cross a page boundary.  Only initialized sections may be
     designated with this directive.  See also *Note TIC54X-Block::.

`.sect "SECTION_NAME"'
     Define a named initialized section and make it the current section.

`SYMBOL .set "VALUE"'
`SYMBOL .equ "VALUE"'
     Equate a constant VALUE to a SYMBOL, which is placed in the symbol
     table.  SYMBOL may not be previously defined.

`.space SIZE_IN_BITS'
`.bes SIZE_IN_BITS'
     Reserve the given number of bits in the current section and
     zero-fill them.  If a label is used with `.space', it points to the
     *first* word reserved.  With `.bes', the label points to the
     *last* word reserved.

`.sslist'
`.ssnolist'
     Controls the inclusion of subsym replacement in the listing
     output.  Ignored.

`.string "STRING" [,...,"STRING_N"]'
`.pstring "STRING" [,...,"STRING_N"]'
     Place 8-bit characters from STRING into the current section.
     `.string' zero-fills the upper 8 bits of each word, while
     `.pstring' puts two characters into each word, filling the
     most-significant bits first.  Unused space is zero-filled.  If a
     label is used, it points to the first word initialized.

`[STAG] .struct [OFFSET]'
`[NAME_1] element [COUNT_1]'
`[NAME_2] element [COUNT_2]'
`[TNAME] .tag STAGX [TCOUNT]'
`...'
`[NAME_N] element [COUNT_N]'
`[SSIZE] .endstruct'
`LABEL .tag [STAG]'
     Assign symbolic offsets to the elements of a structure.  STAG
     defines a symbol to use to reference the structure.  OFFSET
     indicates a starting value to use for the first element
     encountered; otherwise it defaults to zero.  Each element can have
     a named offset, NAME, which is a symbol assigned the value of the
     element's offset into the structure.  If STAG is missing, these
     become global symbols.  COUNT adjusts the offset that many times,
     as if `element' were an array.  `element' may be one of `.byte',
     `.word', `.long', `.float', or any equivalent of those, and the
     structure offset is adjusted accordingly.  `.field' and `.string'
     are also allowed; the size of `.field' is one bit, and `.string'
     is considered to be one word in size.  Only element descriptors,
     structure/union tags, `.align' and conditional assembly directives
     are allowed within `.struct'/`.endstruct'.  `.align' aligns member
     offsets to word boundaries only.  SSIZE, if provided, will always
     be assigned the size of the structure.

     The `.tag' directive, in addition to being used to define a
     structure/union element within a structure, may be used to apply a
     structure to a symbol.  Once applied to LABEL, the individual
     structure elements may be applied to LABEL to produce the desired
     offsets using LABEL as the structure base.

`.tab'
     Set the tab size in the output listing.  Ignored.

`[UTAG] .union'
`[NAME_1] element [COUNT_1]'
`[NAME_2] element [COUNT_2]'
`[TNAME] .tag UTAGX[,TCOUNT]'
`...'
`[NAME_N] element [COUNT_N]'
`[USIZE] .endstruct'
`LABEL .tag [UTAG]'
     Similar to `.struct', but the offset after each element is reset to
     zero, and the USIZE is set to the maximum of all defined elements.
     Starting offset for the union is always zero.

`[SYMBOL] .usect "SECTION_NAME", SIZE, [,[BLOCKING_FLAG] [,ALIGNMENT_FLAG]]'
     Reserve space for variables in a named, uninitialized section
     (similar to .bss).  `.usect' allows definitions sections
     independent of .bss.  SYMBOL points to the first location reserved
     by this allocation.  The symbol may be used as a variable name.
     SIZE is the allocated size in words.  BLOCKING_FLAG indicates
     whether to block this section on a page boundary (128 words)
     (*note TIC54X-Block::).  ALIGNMENT FLAG indicates whether the
     section should be longword-aligned.

`.var SYM[,..., SYM_N]'
     Define a subsym to be a local variable within a macro.  See *Note
     TIC54X-Macros::.

`.version VERSION'
     Set which processor to build instructions for.  Though the
     following values are accepted, the op is ignored.
    `541'
    `542'
    `543'
    `545'
    `545LP'
    `546LP'

Macros
------

   Macros do not require explicit dereferencing of arguments (i.e.
\ARG).

   During macro expansion, the macro parameters are converted to
subsyms.  If the number of arguments passed the macro invocation
exceeds the number of parameters defined, the last parameter is
assigned the string equivalent of all remaining arguments.  If fewer
arguments are given than parameters, the missing parameters are
assigned empty strings.  To include a comma in an argument, you must
enclose the argument in quotes.

   The following built-in subsym functions allow examination of the
string value of subsyms (or ordinary strings).  The arguments are
strings unless otherwise indicated (subsyms passed as args will be
replaced by the strings they represent).
``$symlen(STR)''
     Returns the length of STR.

``$symcmp(STR1,STR2)''
     Returns 0 if STR1 == STR2, non-zero otherwise.

``$firstch(STR,CH)''
     Returns index of the first occurrence of character constant CH in
     STR.

``$lastch(STR,CH)''
     Returns index of the last occurrence of character constant CH in
     STR.

``$isdefed(SYMBOL)''
     Returns zero if the symbol SYMBOL is not in the symbol table,
     non-zero otherwise.

``$ismember(SYMBOL,LIST)''
     Assign the first member of comma-separated string LIST to SYMBOL;
     LIST is reassigned the remainder of the list.  Returns zero if
     LIST is a null string.  Both arguments must be subsyms.

``$iscons(EXPR)''
     Returns 1 if string EXPR is binary, 2 if octal, 3 if hexadecimal,
     4 if a character, 5 if decimal, and zero if not an integer.

``$isname(NAME)''
     Returns 1 if NAME is a valid symbol name, zero otherwise.

``$isreg(REG)''
     Returns 1 if REG is a valid predefined register name (AR0-AR7
     only).

``$structsz(STAG)''
     Returns the size of the structure or union represented by STAG.

``$structacc(STAG)''
     Returns the reference point of the structure or union represented
     by STAG.   Always returns zero.

Z8000 Dependent Features
========================

   The Z8000 as supports both members of the Z8000 family: the
unsegmented Z8002, with 16 bit addresses, and the segmented Z8001 with
24 bit addresses.

   When the assembler is in unsegmented mode (specified with the
`unsegm' directive), an address takes up one word (16 bit) sized
register.  When the assembler is in segmented mode (specified with the
`segm' directive), a 24-bit address takes up a long (32 bit) register.

Register Names
..............

   The Z8000 has sixteen 16 bit registers, numbered 0 to 15.  You can
refer to different sized groups of registers by register number, with
the prefix `r' for 16 bit registers, `rr' for 32 bit registers and `rq'
for 64 bit registers.  You can also refer to the contents of the first
eight (of the sixteen 16 bit registers) by bytes.  They are named `rNh'
and `rNl'.

Addressing Modes
................

   as understands the following addressing modes for the Z8000:

`rN'
     Register direct

`@@rN'
     Indirect register

`ADDR'
     Direct: the 16 bit or 24 bit address (depending on whether the
     assembler is in segmented or unsegmented mode) of the operand is
     in the instruction.

`address(rN)'
     Indexed: the 16 or 24 bit address is added to the 16 bit register
     to produce the final address in memory of the operand.

`rN(#IMM)'
     Base Address: the 16 or 24 bit register is added to the 16 bit sign
     extended immediate displacement to produce the final address in
     memory of the operand.

`rN(rM)'
     Base Index: the 16 or 24 bit register rN is added to the sign
     extended 16 bit index register rM to produce the final address in
     memory of the operand.

`#XX'
     Immediate data XX.

Assembler Directives for the Z8000
----------------------------------

   The Z8000 port of as includes these additional assembler directives,
for compatibility with other Z8000 assemblers.  As shown, these do not
begin with `.' (unlike the ordinary as directives).

`segm'
     Generates code for the segmented Z8001.

`unsegm'
     Generates code for the unsegmented Z8002.

`name'
     Synonym for `.file'

`global'
     Synonym for `.global'

`wval'
     Synonym for `.word'

`lval'
     Synonym for `.long'

`bval'
     Synonym for `.byte'

`sval'
     Assemble a string.  `sval' expects one string literal, delimited by
     single quotes.  It assembles each byte of the string into
     consecutive addresses.  You can use the escape sequence `%XX'
     (where XX represents a two-digit hexadecimal number) to represent
     the character whose ASCII value is XX.  Use this feature to
     describe single quote and other characters that may not appear in
     string literals as themselves.  For example, the C statement
     `char *a = "he said \"it's 50% off\"";' is represented in Z8000
     assembly language (shown with the assembler output in hex at the
     left) as

          68652073    sval    'he said %22it%27s 50%25 off%22%00'
          61696420
          22697427
          73203530
          25206F66
          662200

`rsect'
     synonym for `.section'

`block'
     synonym for `.space'

`even'
     special case of `.align'; aligns output to even byte boundary.

VAX Command-Line Options
------------------------

   The Vax version of `as' accepts any of the following options, gives
a warning message that the option was ignored and proceeds.  These
options are for compatibility with scripts designed for other people's
assemblers.

``-D' (Debug)'
``-S' (Symbol Table)'
``-T' (Token Trace)'
     These are obsolete options used to debug old assemblers.

``-d' (Displacement size for JUMPs)'
     This option expects a number following the `-d'.  Like options
     that expect filenames, the number may immediately follow the `-d'
     (old standard) or constitute the whole of the command line
     argument that follows `-d' (GNU standard).

``-V' (Virtualize Interpass Temporary File)'
     Some other assemblers use a temporary file.  This option commanded
     them to keep the information in active memory rather than in a
     disk file.  `as' always does this, so this option is redundant.

``-J' (JUMPify Longer Branches)'
     Many 32-bit computers permit a variety of branch instructions to
     do the same job.  Some of these instructions are short (and fast)
     but have a limited range; others are long (and slow) but can
     branch anywhere in virtual memory.  Often there are 3 flavors of
     branch: short, medium and long.  Some other assemblers would emit
     short and medium branches, unless told by this option to emit
     short and long branches.

``-t' (Temporary File Directory)'
     Some other assemblers may use a temporary file, and this option
     takes a filename being the directory to site the temporary file.
     Since `as' does not use a temporary disk file, this option makes
     no difference.  `-t' needs exactly one filename.

   The Vax version of the assembler accepts additional options when
compiled for VMS:

`-h N'
     External symbol or section (used for global variables) names are
     not case sensitive on VAX/VMS and always mapped to upper case.
     This is contrary to the C language definition which explicitly
     distinguishes upper and lower case.  To implement a standard
     conforming C compiler, names must be changed (mapped) to preserve
     the case information.  The default mapping is to convert all lower
     case characters to uppercase and adding an underscore followed by
     a 6 digit hex value, representing a 24 digit binary value.  The
     one digits in the binary value represent which characters are
     uppercase in the original symbol name.

     The `-h N' option determines how we map names.  This takes several
     values.  No `-h' switch at all allows case hacking as described
     above.  A value of zero (`-h0') implies names should be upper
     case, and inhibits the case hack.  A value of 2 (`-h2') implies
     names should be all lower case, with no case hack.  A value of 3
     (`-h3') implies that case should be preserved.  The value 1 is
     unused.  The `-H' option directs `as' to display every mapped
     symbol during assembly.

     Symbols whose names include a dollar sign `$' are exceptions to the
     general name mapping.  These symbols are normally only used to
     reference VMS library names.  Such symbols are always mapped to
     upper case.

`-+'
     The `-+' option causes `as' to truncate any symbol name larger
     than 31 characters.  The `-+' option also prevents some code
     following the `_main' symbol normally added to make the object
     file compatible with Vax-11 "C".

`-1'
     This option is ignored for backward compatibility with `as'
     version 1.x.

`-H'
     The `-H' option causes `as' to print every symbol which was
     changed by case mapping.

VAX Floating Point
------------------

   Conversion of flonums to floating point is correct, and compatible
with previous assemblers.  Rounding is towards zero if the remainder is
exactly half the least significant bit.

   `D', `F', `G' and `H' floating point formats are understood.

   Immediate floating literals (_e.g._ `S`$6.9') are rendered
correctly.  Again, rounding is towards zero in the boundary case.

   The `.float' directive produces `f' format numbers.  The `.double'
directive produces `d' format numbers.

Vax Machine Directives
----------------------

   The Vax version of the assembler supports four directives for
generating Vax floating point constants.  They are described in the
table below.

`.dfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `d' format 64-bit floating point constants.

`.ffloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `f' format 32-bit floating point constants.

`.gfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `g' format 64-bit floating point constants.

`.hfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `h' format 128-bit floating point constants.

VAX Branch Improvement
----------------------

   Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted.  They are for branch
instructions.  They expand to the shortest branch instruction that
reaches the target.  Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting
`j' for `b' at the start of a DEC mnemonic.  This feature is included
both for compatibility and to help compilers.  If you do not need this
feature, avoid these opcodes.  Here are the mnemonics, and the code
they can expand into.

`jbsb'
     `Jsb' is already an instruction mnemonic, so we chose `jbsb'.
    (byte displacement)
          `bsbb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bsbw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jsb ...'

`jbr'
`jr'
     Unconditional branch.
    (byte displacement)
          `brb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `brw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jmp ...'

`jCOND'
     COND may be any one of the conditional branches `neq', `nequ',
     `eql', `eqlu', `gtr', `geq', `lss', `gtru', `lequ', `vc', `vs',
     `gequ', `cc', `lssu', `cs'.  COND may also be one of the bit tests
     `bs', `bc', `bss', `bcs', `bsc', `bcc', `bssi', `bcci', `lbs',
     `lbc'.  NOTCOND is the opposite condition to COND.
    (byte displacement)
          `bCOND ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bNOTCOND foo ; brw ... ; foo:'

    (long displacement)
          `bNOTCOND foo ; jmp ... ; foo:'

`jacbX'
     X may be one of `b d f g h l w'.
    (word displacement)
          `OPCODE ...'

    (long displacement)
               OPCODE ..., foo ;
               brb bar ;
               foo: jmp ... ;
               bar:

VAX Operands
------------

   The immediate character is `$' for Unix compatibility, not `#' as
DEC writes it.

   The indirect character is `*' for Unix compatibility, not `@@' as DEC
writes it.

   The displacement sizing character is ``' (an accent grave) for Unix
compatibility, not `^' as DEC writes it.  The letter preceding ``' may
have either case.  `G' is not understood, but all other letters (`b i l
s w') are understood.

   Register names understood are `r0 r1 r2 ... r15 ap fp sp pc'.  Upper
and lower case letters are equivalent.

   For instance
     tstb *w`$4(r5)

   Any expression is permitted in an operand.  Operands are comma
separated.

Options
-------

   `as' supports the following additional command-line options for the
V850 processor family:

`-wsigned_overflow'
     Causes warnings to be produced when signed immediate values
     overflow the space available for then within their opcodes.  By
     default this option is disabled as it is possible to receive
     spurious warnings due to using exact bit patterns as immediate
     constants.

`-wunsigned_overflow'
     Causes warnings to be produced when unsigned immediate values
     overflow the space available for then within their opcodes.  By
     default this option is disabled as it is possible to receive
     spurious warnings due to using exact bit patterns as immediate
     constants.

`-mv850'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850e'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850any'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor but support instructions that are
     specific to the extended variants of the process.  This allows the
     production of binaries that contain target specific code, but
     which are also intended to be used in a generic fashion.  For
     example libgcc.a contains generic routines used by the code
     produced by GCC for all versions of the v850 architecture,
     together with support routines only used by the V850E architecture.

`.offset <EXPRESSION>'
     Moves the offset into the current section to the specified amount.

`.section "name", <type>'
     This is an extension to the standard .section directive.  It sets
     the current section to be <type> and creates an alias for this
     section called "name".

`.v850'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`.v850e'

File: as.info,  Node: V850 Opcodes,  Prev: V850 Directives,  Up: V850-Dependent

Opcodes
-------

   `as' implements all the standard V850 opcodes.

   `as' also implements the following pseudo ops:

`hi0()'
     Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `mulhi hi0(here - there), r5, r6'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the upper 16 bits of this difference, shifts it
     down 16 bits and then mutliplies it by the lower 16 bits in
     register 5, putting the result into register 6.

`lo()'
     Computes the lower 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `addi lo(here - there), r5, r6'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the lower 16 bits of this difference and adds it to
     register 5, putting the result into register 6.

`hi()'
     Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and then adds
     the value of the most significant bit of the lower 16 bits of the
     expression and stores the result into the immediate operand field
     of the given instruction.  For example the following code can be
     used to compute the address of the label 'here' and store it into
     register 6:

     `movhi hi(here), r0, r6'     `movea lo(here), r6, r6'

     The reason for this special behaviour is that movea performs a sign
     extention on its immediate operand.  So for example if the address
     of 'here' was 0xFFFFFFFF then without the special behaviour of the
     hi() pseudo-op the movhi instruction would put 0xFFFF0000 into r6,
     then the movea instruction would takes its immediate operand,
     0xFFFF, sign extend it to 32 bits, 0xFFFFFFFF, and then add it
     into r6 giving 0xFFFEFFFF which is wrong (the fifth nibble is E).
     With the hi() pseudo op adding in the top bit of the lo() pseudo
     op, the movhi instruction actually stores 0 into r6 (0xFFFF + 1 =
     0x0000), so that the movea instruction stores 0xFFFFFFFF into r6 -
     the right value.

`hilo()'
     Computes the 32 bit value of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction (which
     must be a mov instruction).  For example:

     `mov hilo(here), r6'

     computes the absolute address of label 'here' and puts the result
     into register 6.

`sdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Small Data Area (whoes address is held in register 4, the GP
     register) and stores the result as a 16 bit signed value in the
     immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For example:

     `ld.w sdaoff(_a_variable)[gp],r6'

     loads the contents of the location pointed to by the label
     '_a_variable' into register 6, provided that the label is located
     somewhere within +/- 32K of the address held in the GP register.
     [Note the linker assumes that the GP register contains a fixed
     address set to the address of the label called '__gp'.  This can
     either be set up automatically by the linker, or specifically set
     by using the `--defsym __gp=<value>' command line option].

`tdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Tiny Data Area (whoes address is held in register 30, the EP
     register) and stores the result as a 4,5, 7 or 8 bit unsigned
     value in the immediate operand field of the given instruction.
     For example:

     `sld.w tdaoff(_a_variable)[ep],r6'

     loads the contents of the location pointed to by the label
     '_a_variable' into register 6, provided that the label is located
     somewhere within +256 bytes of the address held in the EP
     register.  [Note the linker assumes that the EP register contains
     a fixed address set to the address of the label called '__ep'.
     This can either be set up automatically by the linker, or
     specifically set by using the `--defsym __ep=<value>' command line
     option].

`zdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from address 0 and
     stores the result as a 16 bit signed value in the immediate
     operand field of the given instruction.  For example:

     `movea zdaoff(_a_variable),zero,r6'

     puts the address of the label '_a_variable' into register 6,
     assuming that the label is somewhere within the first 32K of
     memory.  (Strictly speaking it also possible to access the last
     32K of memory as well, as the offsets are signed).

`ctoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Call Table Area (whoes address is helg in system register 20, the
     CTBP register) and stores the result a 6 or 16 bit unsigned value
     in the immediate field of then given instruction or piece of data.
     For example:

     `callt ctoff(table_func1)'

     will put the call the function whoes address is held in the call
     table at the location labeled 'table_func1'.

Reporting Bugs
**************

   Your bug reports play an essential role in making `as' reliable.

   Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem,
or it may not.  But in any case the principal function of a bug report
is to help the entire community by making the next version of `as' work
better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of `as'.

   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that enables us to fix the bug.

* Menu:

* Bug Criteria::                Have you found a bug?
* Bug Reporting::               How to report bugs


File: as.info,  Node: Bug Criteria,  Next: Bug Reporting,  Up: Reporting Bugs

Have you found a bug?
=====================

   If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If the assembler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that
     is a `as' bug.  Reliable assemblers never crash.

   * If `as' produces an error message for valid input, that is a bug.

   * If `as' does not produce an error message for invalid input, that
     is a bug.  However, you should note that your idea of "invalid
     input" might be our idea of "an extension" or "support for
     traditional practice".

   * If you are an experienced user of assemblers, your suggestions for
     improvement of `as' are welcome in any case.


File: as.info,  Node: Bug Reporting,  Prev: Bug Criteria,  Up: Reporting Bugs

How to report bugs
==================

   A number of companies and individuals offer support for GNU
products.  If you obtained `as' from a support organization, we
recommend you contact that organization first.

   You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file `etc/SERVICE' in the GNU Emacs distribution.

   In any event, we also recommend that you send bug reports for `as'
to `bug-binutils@@gnu.org'.

   The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
*report all the facts*.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or
leave it out, state it!

   Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of a symbol you use in an example does not matter.
Well, probably it does not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps the bug
is a stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the location
where that name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were
different, the contents of that location would fool the assembler into
doing the right thing despite the bug.  Play it safe and give a
specific, complete example.  That is the easiest thing for you to do,
and the most helpful.

   Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix
the bug if it is new to us.  Therefore, always write your bug reports
on the assumption that the bug has not been reported previously.

   Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
bell?"  Those bug reports are useless, and we urge everyone to _refuse
to respond to them_ except to chide the sender to report bugs properly.

   To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:

   * The version of `as'.  `as' announces it if you start it with the
     `--version' argument.

     Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in
     looking for the bug in the current version of `as'.

   * Any patches you may have applied to the `as' source.

   * The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name
     and version number.

   * What compiler (and its version) was used to compile `as'--e.g.
     "`gcc-2.7'".

   * The command arguments you gave the assembler to assemble your
     example and observe the bug.  To guarantee you will not omit
     something important, list them all.  A copy of the Makefile (or
     the output from make) is sufficient.

     If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess
     wrong and then we might not encounter the bug.

   * A complete input file that will reproduce the bug.  If the bug is
     observed when the assembler is invoked via a compiler, send the
     assembler source, not the high level language source.  Most
     compilers will produce the assembler source when run with the `-S'
     option.  If you are using `gcc', use the options `-v
     --save-temps'; this will save the assembler source in a file with
     an extension of `.s', and also show you exactly how `as' is being
     run.

   * A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
     incorrect.  For example, "It gets a fatal signal."

     Of course, if the bug is that `as' gets a fatal signal, then we
     will certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we
     might not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You might as well
     not give us a chance to make a mistake.

     Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should
     still say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on,
     such as, your copy of `as' is out of synch, or you have
     encountered a bug in the C library on your system.  (This has
     happened!)  Your copy might crash and ours would not.  If you told
     us to expect a crash, then when ours fails to crash, we would know
     that the bug was not happening for us.  If you had not told us to
     expect a crash, then we would not be able to draw any conclusion
     from our observations.

   * If you wish to suggest changes to the `as' source, send us context
     diffs, as generated by `diff' with the `-u', `-c', or `-p' option.
     Always send diffs from the old file to the new file.  If you even
     discuss something in the `as' source, refer to it by context, not
     by line number.

     The line numbers in our development sources will not match those
     in your sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful
     information to us.

   Here are some things that are not necessary:

   * A description of the envelope of the bug.

     Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
     which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
     changes will not affect it.

     This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way
     we will find the bug is by running a single example under the
     debugger with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of
     examples.  We recommend that you save your time for something else.

     Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report _instead_
     of the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
     output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
     less time, and so on.

     However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do
     this, report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you
     used.

   * A patch for the bug.

     A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not
     omit the necessary information, such as the test case, on the
     assumption that a patch is all we need.  We might see problems
     with your patch and decide to fix the problem another way, or we
     might not understand it at all.

     Sometimes with a program as complicated as `as' it is very hard to
     construct an example that will make the program follow a certain
     path through the code.  If you do not send us the example, we will
     not be able to construct one, so we will not be able to verify
     that the bug is fixed.

     And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why
     your patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A
     test case will help us to understand.

   * A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

     Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about
     such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

****************

   If you have contributed to `as' and your name isn't listed here, it
is not meant as a slight.  We just don't know about it.  Send mail to
the maintainer, and we'll correct the situation.  Currently the
maintainer is Ken Raeburn (email address `raeburn@@cygnus.com').

   Dean Elsner wrote the original GNU assembler for the VAX.(1)

   Jay Fenlason maintained GAS for a while, adding support for
GDB-specific debug information and the 68k series machines, most of the
preprocessing pass, and extensive changes in `messages.c',
`input-file.c', `write.c'.

   K. Richard Pixley maintained GAS for a while, adding various
enhancements and many bug fixes, including merging support for several
processors, breaking GAS up to handle multiple object file format back
ends (including heavy rewrite, testing, an integration of the coff and
b.out back ends), adding configuration including heavy testing and
verification of cross assemblers and file splits and renaming,
converted GAS to strictly ANSI C including full prototypes, added
support for m680[34]0 and cpu32, did considerable work on i960
including a COFF port (including considerable amounts of reverse
engineering), a SPARC opcode file rewrite, DECstation, rs6000, and
hp300hpux host ports, updated "know" assertions and made them work,
much other reorganization, cleanup, and lint.

   Ken Raeburn wrote the high-level BFD interface code to replace most
of the code in format-specific I/O modules.

   The original VMS support was contributed by David L. Kashtan.  Eric
Youngdale has done much work with it since.

   The Intel 80386 machine description was written by Eliot Dresselhaus.

   Minh Tran-Le at IntelliCorp contributed some AIX 386 support.

   The Motorola 88k machine description was contributed by Devon Bowen
of Buffalo University and Torbjorn Granlund of the Swedish Institute of
Computer Science.

   Keith Knowles at the Open Software Foundation wrote the original
MIPS back end (`tc-mips.c', `tc-mips.h'), and contributed Rose format
support (which hasn't been merged in yet).  Ralph Campbell worked with
the MIPS code to support a.out format.

   Support for the Zilog Z8k and Hitachi H8/300 and H8/500 processors
(tc-z8k, tc-h8300, tc-h8500), and IEEE 695 object file format
(obj-ieee), was written by Steve Chamberlain of Cygnus Support.  Steve
also modified the COFF back end to use BFD for some low-level
operations, for use with the H8/300 and AMD 29k targets.

   John Gilmore built the AMD 29000 support, added `.include' support,
and simplified the configuration of which versions accept which
directives.  He updated the 68k machine description so that Motorola's
opcodes always produced fixed-size instructions (e.g. `jsr'), while
synthetic instructions remained shrinkable (`jbsr').  John fixed many
bugs, including true tested cross-compilation support, and one bug in
relaxation that took a week and required the proverbial one-bit fix.

   Ian Lance Taylor of Cygnus Support merged the Motorola and MIT
syntax for the 68k, completed support for some COFF targets (68k, i386
SVR3, and SCO Unix), added support for MIPS ECOFF and ELF targets,
wrote the initial RS/6000 and PowerPC assembler, and made a few other
minor patches.

   Steve Chamberlain made `as' able to generate listings.

   Hewlett-Packard contributed support for the HP9000/300.

   Jeff Law wrote GAS and BFD support for the native HPPA object format
(SOM) along with a fairly extensive HPPA testsuite (for both SOM and
ELF object formats).  This work was supported by both the Center for
Software Science at the University of Utah and Cygnus Support.

   Support for ELF format files has been worked on by Mark Eichin of
Cygnus Support (original, incomplete implementation for SPARC), Pete
Hoogenboom and Jeff Law at the University of Utah (HPPA mainly),
Michael Meissner of the Open Software Foundation (i386 mainly), and Ken
Raeburn of Cygnus Support (sparc, and some initial 64-bit support).

   Linas Vepstas added GAS support for the ESA/390 "IBM 370"

VAX Opcodes
-----------

   All DEC mnemonics are supported.  Beware that `case...' instructions
have exactly 3 operands.  The dispatch table that follows the `case...'
instruction should be made with `.word' statements.  This is compatible
with all unix assemblers we know of.

VAX Branch Improvement
----------------------

   Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted.  They are for branch
instructions.  They expand to the shortest branch instruction that
reaches the target.  Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting
`j' for `b' at the start of a DEC mnemonic.  This feature is included
both for compatibility and to help compilers.  If you do not need this
feature, avoid these opcodes.  Here are the mnemonics, and the code
they can expand into.

`jbsb'
     `Jsb' is already an instruction mnemonic, so we chose `jbsb'.
    (byte displacement)
          `bsbb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bsbw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jsb ...'

`jbr'
`jr'
     Unconditional branch.
    (byte displacement)
          `brb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `brw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jmp ...'

`jCOND'
     COND may be any one of the conditional branches `neq', `nequ',
     `eql', `eqlu', `gtr', `geq', `lss', `gtru', `lequ', `vc', `vs',
     `gequ', `cc', `lssu', `cs'.  COND may also be one of the bit tests
     `bs', `bc', `bss', `bcs', `bsc', `bcc', `bssi', `bcci', `lbs',
     `lbc'.  NOTCOND is the opposite condition to COND.
    (byte displacement)
          `bCOND ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bNOTCOND foo ; brw ... ; foo:'

    (long displacement)
          `bNOTCOND foo ; jmp ... ; foo:'

`jacbX'
     X may be one of `b d f g h l w'.

VAX Operands
------------

   The immediate character is `$' for Unix compatibility, not `#' as
DEC writes it.

   The indirect character is `*' for Unix compatibility, not `@@' as DEC
writes it.

   The displacement sizing character is ``' (an accent grave) for Unix
compatibility, not `^' as DEC writes it.  The letter preceding ``' may
have either case.  `G' is not understood, but all other letters (`b i l
s w') are understood.

   Register names understood are `r0 r1 r2 ... r15 ap fp sp pc'.  Upper
and lower case letters are equivalent.

   For instance
     tstb *w`$4(r5)

   Any expression is permitted in an operand.  Operands are comma
separated.

Options
-------

   `as' supports the following additional command-line options for the
V850 processor family:

`-wsigned_overflow'
     Causes warnings to be produced when signed immediate values
     overflow the space available for then within their opcodes.  By
     default this option is disabled as it is possible to receive
     spurious warnings due to using exact bit patterns as immediate
     constants.

`-wunsigned_overflow'
     Causes warnings to be produced when unsigned immediate values
     overflow the space available for then within their opcodes.  By
     default this option is disabled as it is possible to receive
     spurious warnings due to using exact bit patterns as immediate
     constants.

`-mv850'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850e'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850any'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor but support instructions that are
     specific to the extended variants of the process.  This allows the
     production of binaries that contain target specific code, but
     which are also intended to be used in a generic fashion.  For
     example libgcc.a contains generic routines used by the code
     produced by GCC for all versions of the v850 architecture,
     together with support routines only used by the V850E architecture.

     the current section to be <type> and creates an alias for this
     section called "name".

`.v850'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

File: as.info,  Node: V850 Opcodes,  Prev: V850 Directives,  Up: V850-Dependent

Opcodes
-------

   `as' implements all the standard V850 opcodes.

   `as' also implements the following pseudo ops:

`hi0()'
     Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `mulhi hi0(here - there), r5, r6'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the upper 16 bits of this difference, shifts it
     down 16 bits and then mutliplies it by the lower 16 bits in
     register 5, putting the result into register 6.

`lo()'
     Computes the lower 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `addi lo(here - there), r5, r6'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the lower 16 bits of this difference and adds it to
     register 5, putting the result into register 6.

`hi()'
     Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and then adds
     the value of the most significant bit of the lower 16 bits of the
     expression and stores the result into the immediate operand field
     of the given instruction.  For example the following code can be
     used to compute the address of the label 'here' and store it into
     register 6:

     `movhi hi(here), r0, r6'     `movea lo(here), r6, r6'

     The reason for this special behaviour is that movea performs a sign
     extention on its immediate operand.  So for example if the address
     of 'here' was 0xFFFFFFFF then without the special behaviour of the
     hi() pseudo-op the movhi instruction would put 0xFFFF0000 into r6,
     then the movea instruction would takes its immediate operand,
     0xFFFF, sign extend it to 32 bits, 0xFFFFFFFF, and then add it
     into r6 giving 0xFFFEFFFF which is wrong (the fifth nibble is E).
     With the hi() pseudo op adding in the top bit of the lo() pseudo
     op, the movhi instruction actually stores 0 into r6 (0xFFFF + 1 =
     0x0000), so that the movea instruction stores 0xFFFFFFFF into r6 -
     the right value.

`hilo()'
     Computes the 32 bit value of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction (which
     must be a mov instruction).  For example:

     `mov hilo(here), r6'

     computes the absolute address of label 'here' and puts the result
     into register 6.

`sdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Small Data Area (whoes address is held in register 4, the GP
     register) and stores the result as a 16 bit signed value in the
     immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For example:

     `ld.w sdaoff(_a_variable)[gp],r6'

     loads the contents of the location pointed to by the label
     '_a_variable' into register 6, provided that the label is located
     somewhere within +/- 32K of the address held in the GP register.
     [Note the linker assumes that the GP register contains a fixed
     address set to the address of the label called '__gp'.  This can
     either be set up automatically by the linker, or specifically set
     by using the `--defsym __gp=<value>' command line option].

`tdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Tiny Data Area (whoes address is held in register 30, the EP
     register) and stores the result as a 4,5, 7 or 8 bit unsigned
     value in the immediate operand field of the given instruction.
     For example:

     `sld.w tdaoff(_a_variable)[ep],r6'

     loads the contents of the location pointed to by the label
     '_a_variable' into register 6, provided that the label is located
     somewhere within +256 bytes of the address held in the EP
     register.  [Note the linker assumes that the EP register contains
     a fixed address set to the address of the label called '__ep'.
     This can either be set up automatically by the linker, or
     specifically set by using the `--defsym __ep=<value>' command line
     option].

`zdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from address 0 and
     stores the result as a 16 bit signed value in the immediate
     operand field of the given instruction.  For example:

     `movea zdaoff(_a_variable),zero,r6'

     puts the address of the label '_a_variable' into register 6,
     assuming that the label is somewhere within the first 32K of
     memory.  (Strictly speaking it also possible to access the last
     32K of memory as well, as the offsets are signed).

`ctoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Call Table Area (whoes address is helg in system register 20, the
     CTBP register) and stores the result a 6 or 16 bit unsigned value
     in the immediate field of then given instruction or piece of data.
     For example:

     `callt ctoff(table_func1)'

     will put the call the function whoes address is held in the call
     table at the location labeled 'table_func1'.

Reporting Bugs
**************

   Your bug reports play an essential role in making `as' reliable.

   Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem,
or it may not.  But in any case the principal function of a bug report
is to help the entire community by making the next version of `as' work
better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of `as'.

   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that enables us to fix the bug.

Have you found a bug?
=====================

   If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If the assembler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that
     is a `as' bug.  Reliable assemblers never crash.

   * If `as' produces an error message for valid input, that is a bug.

   * If `as' does not produce an error message for invalid input, that
     is a bug.  However, you should note that your idea of "invalid
     input" might be our idea of "an extension" or "support for
     traditional practice".

   * If you are an experienced user of assemblers, your suggestions for
     improvement of `as' are welcome in any case.


File: as.info,  Node: Bug Reporting,  Prev: Bug Criteria,  Up: Reporting Bugs

How to report bugs
==================

   A number of companies and individuals offer support for GNU
products.  If you obtained `as' from a support organization, we
recommend you contact that organization first.

   You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file `etc/SERVICE' in the GNU Emacs distribution.

   In any event, we also recommend that you send bug reports for `as'
to `bug-binutils@@gnu.org'.

   The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
*report all the facts*.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or
leave it out, state it!

   Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of a symbol you use in an example does not matter.
Well, probably it does not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps the bug
is a stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the location
where that name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were
different, the contents of that location would fool the assembler into
doing the right thing despite the bug.  Play it safe and give a
specific, complete example.  That is the easiest thing for you to do,
and the most helpful.

   Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix
the bug if it is new to us.  Therefore, always write your bug reports
on the assumption that the bug has not been reported previously.

   Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
bell?"  Those bug reports are useless, and we urge everyone to _refuse
to respond to them_ except to chide the sender to report bugs properly.

   To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:

   * The version of `as'.  `as' announces it if you start it with the
     `--version' argument.

     Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in
     looking for the bug in the current version of `as'.

   * Any patches you may have applied to the `as' source.

   * The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name
     and version number.

   * What compiler (and its version) was used to compile `as'--e.g.
     "`gcc-2.7'".

   * The command arguments you gave the assembler to assemble your
     example and observe the bug.  To guarantee you will not omit
     something important, list them all.  A copy of the Makefile (or
     the output from make) is sufficient.

     If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess
     wrong and then we might not encounter the bug.

   * A complete input file that will reproduce the bug.  If the bug is
     observed when the assembler is invoked via a compiler, send the
     assembler source, not the high level language source.  Most
     compilers will produce the assembler source when run with the `-S'
     option.  If you are using `gcc', use the options `-v
     --save-temps'; this will save the assembler source in a file with
     an extension of `.s', and also show you exactly how `as' is being
     run.

   * A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
     incorrect.  For example, "It gets a fatal signal."

     Of course, if the bug is that `as' gets a fatal signal, then we
     will certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we
     might not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You might as well
     not give us a chance to make a mistake.

     Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should
     still say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on,
     such as, your copy of `as' is out of synch, or you have
     encountered a bug in the C library on your system.  (This has
     happened!)  Your copy might crash and ours would not.  If you told
     us to expect a crash, then when ours fails to crash, we would know
     that the bug was not happening for us.  If you had not told us to
     expect a crash, then we would not be able to draw any conclusion
     from our observations.

   * If you wish to suggest changes to the `as' source, send us context
     diffs, as generated by `diff' with the `-u', `-c', or `-p' option.
     Always send diffs from the old file to the new file.  If you even
     discuss something in the `as' source, refer to it by context, not
     by line number.

     The line numbers in our development sources will not match those
     in your sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful
     information to us.

   Here are some things that are not necessary:

   * A description of the envelope of the bug.

     Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
     which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
     changes will not affect it.

     This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way
     we will find the bug is by running a single example under the
     debugger with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of
     examples.  We recommend that you save your time for something else.

     Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report _instead_
     of the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
     output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
     less time, and so on.

     However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do
     this, report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you
     used.

   * A patch for the bug.

     A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not
     omit the necessary information, such as the test case, on the
     assumption that a patch is all we need.  We might see problems
     with your patch and decide to fix the problem another way, or we
     might not understand it at all.

     Sometimes with a program as complicated as `as' it is very hard to
     construct an example that will make the program follow a certain
     path through the code.  If you do not send us the example, we will
     not be able to construct one, so we will not be able to verify
     that the bug is fixed.

     And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why
     your patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A
     test case will help us to understand.

   * A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

     Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about
     such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

   If you have contributed to `as' and your name isn't listed here, it
is not meant as a slight.  We just don't know about it.  Send mail to
the maintainer, and we'll correct the situation.  Currently the
maintainer is Ken Raeburn (email address `raeburn@@cygnus.com').

   Dean Elsner wrote the original GNU assembler for the VAX.(1)

   Jay Fenlason maintained GAS for a while, adding support for
GDB-specific debug information and the 68k series machines, most of the
preprocessing pass, and extensive changes in `messages.c',
`input-file.c', `write.c'.

   K. Richard Pixley maintained GAS for a while, adding various
enhancements and many bug fixes, including merging support for several
processors, breaking GAS up to handle multiple object file format back
ends (including heavy rewrite, testing, an integration of the coff and
b.out back ends), adding configuration including heavy testing and
verification of cross assemblers and file splits and renaming,
converted GAS to strictly ANSI C including full prototypes, added
support for m680[34]0 and cpu32, did considerable work on i960
including a COFF port (including considerable amounts of reverse
engineering), a SPARC opcode file rewrite, DECstation, rs6000, and
hp300hpux host ports, updated "know" assertions and made them work,
much other reorganization, cleanup, and lint.

   Ken Raeburn wrote the high-level BFD interface code to replace most
of the code in format-specific I/O modules.

   The original VMS support was contributed by David L. Kashtan.  Eric
Youngdale has done much work with it since.

   The Intel 80386 machine description was written by Eliot Dresselhaus.

   Minh Tran-Le at IntelliCorp contributed some AIX 386 support.

   The Motorola 88k machine description was contributed by Devon Bowen
of Buffalo University and Torbjorn Granlund of the Swedish Institute of
Computer Science.

   Keith Knowles at the Open Software Foundation wrote the original
MIPS back end (`tc-mips.c', `tc-mips.h'), and contributed Rose format
support (which hasn't been merged in yet).  Ralph Campbell worked with
the MIPS code to support a.out format.

   Support for the Zilog Z8k and Hitachi H8/300 and H8/500 processors
(tc-z8k, tc-h8300, tc-h8500), and IEEE 695 object file format
(obj-ieee), was written by Steve Chamberlain of Cygnus Support.  Steve
also modified the COFF back end to use BFD for some low-level
operations, for use with the H8/300 and AMD 29k targets.

   John Gilmore built the AMD 29000 support, added `.include' support,
and simplified the configuration of which versions accept which
directives.  He updated the 68k machine description so that Motorola's
opcodes always produced fixed-size instructions (e.g. `jsr'), while
synthetic instructions remained shrinkable (`jbsr').  John fixed many
bugs, including true tested cross-compilation support, and one bug in
relaxation that took a week and required the proverbial one-bit fix.

   Ian Lance Taylor of Cygnus Support merged the Motorola and MIT
syntax for the 68k, completed support for some COFF targets (68k, i386
SVR3, and SCO Unix), added support for MIPS ECOFF and ELF targets,
wrote the initial RS/6000 and PowerPC assembler, and made a few other
minor patches.

   Steve Chamberlain made `as' able to generate listings.

   Hewlett-Packard contributed support for the HP9000/300.

   Jeff Law wrote GAS and BFD support for the native HPPA object format
(SOM) along with a fairly extensive HPPA testsuite (for both SOM and
ELF object formats).  This work was supported by both the Center for
Software Science at the University of Utah and Cygnus Support.

   Support for ELF format files has been worked on by Mark Eichin of
Cygnus Support (original, incomplete implementation for SPARC), Pete
Hoogenboom and Jeff Law at the University of Utah (HPPA mainly),
Michael Meissner of the Open Software Foundation (i386 mainly), and Ken
Raeburn of Cygnus Support (sparc, and some initial 64-bit support).

   Linas Vepstas added GAS support for the ESA/390 "IBM 370"
architecture.

   Richard Henderson rewrote the Alpha assembler. Klaus Kaempf wrote
GAS and BFD support for openVMS/Alpha.

   Timothy Wall, Michael Hayes, and Greg Smart contributed to the
various tic* flavors.

   Several engineers at Cygnus Support have also provided many small
bug fixes and configuration enhancements.

   Many others have contributed large or small bugfixes and
enhancements.  If you have contributed significant work and are not
mentioned on this list, and want to be, let us know.  Some of the
history has been lost; we are not intentionally leaving anyone out.

   GNU Free Documentation License

   Version 1.1, March 2000

   Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.    59 Temple
Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

   Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies  of
this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

   0. PREAMBLE

   The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the
effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit
for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

   1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as "you".

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to
text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format
whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent
modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is not
"Transparent" is called "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML
designed for human modification.  Opaque formats include PostScript,
PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated
HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

   2. VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

   3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these
Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts
on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present the
full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.
You may add other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with
changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of
the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
Document.

   4. MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the
Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of
it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

   A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
  from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.  B. List on
the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).  C.
State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the    Modified
Version, as the publisher.  D. Preserve all the copyright notices of
the Document.  E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your
modifications    adjacent to the other copyright notices.  F. Include,
immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice    giving the
public permission to use the Modified Version under the    terms of
this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.  G. Preserve in
that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections    and
required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.  H.
Include an unaltered copy of this License.  I. Preserve the section
entitled "History", and its title, and add to    it an item stating at
least the title, year, new authors, and    publisher of the Modified
Version as given on the Title Page.  If    there is no section entitled
"History" in the Document, create one    stating the title, year,
authors, and publisher of the Document as    given on its Title Page,
then add an item describing the Modified    Version as stated in the
previous sentence.  J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in
the Document for    public access to a Transparent copy of the
Document, and likewise    the network locations given in the Document
for previous versions    it was based on.  These may be placed in the
"History" section.     You may omit a network location for a work that
was published at    least four years before the Document itself, or if
the original    publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
and/or dedications given therein.  L. Preserve all the Invariant
Sections of the Document,    unaltered in their text and in their
titles.  Section numbers    or the equivalent are not considered part
of the section titles.  M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".
Such a section    may not be included in the Modified Version.  N. Do
not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"    or to conflict in
title with any Invariant Section.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and
a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already includes
a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by
arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you
may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

   5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant
Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
"History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
and any sections entitled "Dedications".  You must delete all sections
entitled "Endorsements."

   6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
documents released under this License, and replace the individual
copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that
is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of
this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other
respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
document.

   7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of
the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are
not themselves derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate.  Otherwise
they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

   8. TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the original
English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement between the
translation and the original English version of this License, the
original English version will prevail.

   9. TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt
to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

   10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.

   ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

         Copyright (c)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
         Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
         under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
         or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
         Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
         A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
         Free Documentation License".

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover
Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being
LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
