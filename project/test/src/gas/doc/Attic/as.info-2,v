8.11.6 Memory References
------------------------

An Intel syntax indirect memory reference of the form

     SECTION:[BASE + INDEX*SCALE + DISP]

is translated into the AT&T syntax

     SECTION:DISP(BASE, INDEX, SCALE)

where BASE and INDEX are the optional 32-bit base and index registers,
DISP is the optional displacement, and SCALE, taking the values 1, 2,
4, and 8, multiplies INDEX to calculate the address of the operand.  If
no SCALE is specified, SCALE is taken to be 1.  SECTION specifies the
optional section register for the memory operand, and may override the
default section register (see a 80386 manual for section register
defaults). Note that section overrides in AT&T syntax _must_ be
preceded by a `%'.  If you specify a section override which coincides
with the default section register, `as' does _not_ output any section
register override prefixes to assemble the given instruction.  Thus,
section overrides can be specified to emphasize which section register
is used for a given memory operand.

   Here are some examples of Intel and AT&T style memory references:

AT&T: `-4(%ebp)', Intel:  `[ebp - 4]'
     BASE is `%ebp'; DISP is `-4'. SECTION is missing, and the default
     section is used (`%ss' for addressing with `%ebp' as the base
     register).  INDEX, SCALE are both missing.

AT&T: `foo(,%eax,4)', Intel: `[foo + eax*4]'
     INDEX is `%eax' (scaled by a SCALE 4); DISP is `foo'.  All other
     fields are missing.  The section register here defaults to `%ds'.

AT&T: `foo(,1)'; Intel `[foo]'
     This uses the value pointed to by `foo' as a memory operand.  Note
     that BASE and INDEX are both missing, but there is only _one_ `,'.
     This is a syntactic exception.

AT&T: `%gs:foo'; Intel `gs:foo'
     This selects the contents of the variable `foo' with section
     register SECTION being `%gs'.

   Absolute (as opposed to PC relative) call and jump operands must be
prefixed with `*'.  If no `*' is specified, `as' always chooses PC
relative addressing for jump/call labels.

   Any instruction that has a memory operand, but no register operand,
_must_ specify its size (byte, word, long, or quadruple) with an
instruction mnemonic suffix (`b', `w', `l' or `q', respectively).

   The x86-64 architecture adds an RIP (instruction pointer relative)
addressing.  This addressing mode is specified by using `rip' as a base
register.  Only constant offsets are valid. For example:

AT&T: `1234(%rip)', Intel: `[rip + 1234]'
     Points to the address 1234 bytes past the end of the current
     instruction.

AT&T: `symbol(%rip)', Intel: `[rip + symbol]'
     Points to the `symbol' in RIP relative way, this is shorter than
     the default absolute addressing.

   Other addressing modes remain unchanged in x86-64 architecture,
except registers used are 64-bit instead of 32-bit.

8.11.7 Handling of Jump Instructions
------------------------------------

Jump instructions are always optimized to use the smallest possible
displacements.  This is accomplished by using byte (8-bit) displacement
jumps whenever the target is sufficiently close.  If a byte displacement
is insufficient a long displacement is used.  We do not support word
(16-bit) displacement jumps in 32-bit mode (i.e. prefixing the jump
instruction with the `data16' instruction prefix), since the 80386
insists upon masking `%eip' to 16 bits after the word displacement is
added. (See also *note i386-Arch::)

   Note that the `jcxz', `jecxz', `loop', `loopz', `loope', `loopnz'
and `loopne' instructions only come in byte displacements, so that if
you use these instructions (`gcc' does not use them) you may get an
error message (and incorrect code).  The AT&T 80386 assembler tries to
get around this problem by expanding `jcxz foo' to

              jcxz cx_zero
              jmp cx_nonzero
     cx_zero: jmp foo
     cx_nonzero:

8.11.8 Floating Point
---------------------

All 80387 floating point types except packed BCD are supported.  (BCD
support may be added without much difficulty).  These data types are
16-, 32-, and 64- bit integers, and single (32-bit), double (64-bit),
and extended (80-bit) precision floating point.  Each supported type
has an instruction mnemonic suffix and a constructor associated with
it.  Instruction mnemonic suffixes specify the operand's data type.
Constructors build these data types into memory.

   * Floating point constructors are `.float' or `.single', `.double',
     and `.tfloat' for 32-, 64-, and 80-bit formats.  These correspond
     to instruction mnemonic suffixes `s', `l', and `t'. `t' stands for
     80-bit (ten byte) real.  The 80387 only supports this format via
     the `fldt' (load 80-bit real to stack top) and `fstpt' (store
     80-bit real and pop stack) instructions.

   * Integer constructors are `.word', `.long' or `.int', and `.quad'
     for the 16-, 32-, and 64-bit integer formats.  The corresponding
     instruction mnemonic suffixes are `s' (single), `l' (long), and
     `q' (quad).  As with the 80-bit real format, the 64-bit `q' format
     is only present in the `fildq' (load quad integer to stack top)
     and `fistpq' (store quad integer and pop stack) instructions.

   Register to register operations should not use instruction mnemonic
suffixes.  `fstl %st, %st(1)' will give a warning, and be assembled as
if you wrote `fst %st, %st(1)', since all register to register
operations use 80-bit floating point operands. (Contrast this with
`fstl %st, mem', which converts `%st' from 80-bit to 64-bit floating
point format, then stores the result in the 4 byte location `mem')

8.11.9 Intel's MMX and AMD's 3DNow! SIMD Operations
---------------------------------------------------

`as' supports Intel's MMX instruction set (SIMD instructions for
integer data), available on Intel's Pentium MMX processors and Pentium
II processors, AMD's K6 and K6-2 processors, Cyrix' M2 processor, and
probably others.  It also supports AMD's 3DNow!  instruction set (SIMD
instructions for 32-bit floating point data) available on AMD's K6-2
processor and possibly others in the future.

   Currently, `as' does not support Intel's floating point SIMD, Katmai
(KNI).

   The eight 64-bit MMX operands, also used by 3DNow!, are called
`%mm0', `%mm1', ... `%mm7'.  They contain eight 8-bit integers, four
16-bit integers, two 32-bit integers, one 64-bit integer, or two 32-bit
floating point values.  The MMX registers cannot be used at the same
time as the floating point stack.

   See Intel and AMD documentation, keeping in mind that the operand
order in instructions is reversed from the Intel syntax.

8.11.10 Writing 16-bit Code
---------------------------

While `as' normally writes only "pure" 32-bit i386 code or 64-bit
x86-64 code depending on the default configuration, it also supports
writing code to run in real mode or in 16-bit protected mode code
segments.  To do this, put a `.code16' or `.code16gcc' directive before
the assembly language instructions to be run in 16-bit mode.  You can
switch `as' back to writing normal 32-bit code with the `.code32'
directive.

   `.code16gcc' provides experimental support for generating 16-bit
code from gcc, and differs from `.code16' in that `call', `ret',
`enter', `leave', `push', `pop', `pusha', `popa', `pushf', and `popf'
instructions default to 32-bit size.  This is so that the stack pointer
is manipulated in the same way over function calls, allowing access to
function parameters at the same stack offsets as in 32-bit mode.
`.code16gcc' also automatically adds address size prefixes where
necessary to use the 32-bit addressing modes that gcc generates.

   The code which `as' generates in 16-bit mode will not necessarily
run on a 16-bit pre-80386 processor.  To write code that runs on such a
processor, you must refrain from using _any_ 32-bit constructs which
require `as' to output address or operand size prefixes.

   Note that writing 16-bit code instructions by explicitly specifying a
prefix or an instruction mnemonic suffix within a 32-bit code section
generates different machine instructions than those generated for a
16-bit code segment.  In a 32-bit code section, the following code
generates the machine opcode bytes `66 6a 04', which pushes the value
`4' onto the stack, decrementing `%esp' by 2.

             pushw $4

   The same code in a 16-bit code section would generate the machine
opcode bytes `6a 04' (ie. without the operand size prefix), which is
correct since the processor default operand size is assumed to be 16
bits in a 16-bit code section.

8.11.11 AT&T Syntax bugs
------------------------

The UnixWare assembler, and probably other AT&T derived ix86 Unix
assemblers, generate floating point instructions with reversed source
and destination registers in certain cases.  Unfortunately, gcc and
possibly many other programs use this reversed syntax, so we're stuck
with it.

   For example

             fsub %st,%st(3)
   results in `%st(3)' being updated to `%st - %st(3)' rather than the
expected `%st(3) - %st'.  This happens with all the non-commutative
arithmetic floating point operations with two register operands where
the source register is `%st' and the destination register is `%st(i)'.

8.11.12 Specifying CPU Architecture
-----------------------------------

`as' may be told to assemble for a particular CPU (sub-)architecture
with the `.arch CPU_TYPE' directive.  This directive enables a warning
when gas detects an instruction that is not supported on the CPU
specified.  The choices for CPU_TYPE are:

`i8086'        `i186'         `i286'         `i386'
`i486'         `i586'         `i686'         `pentium'
`pentiumpro'   `pentiumii'    `pentiumiii'   `pentium4'
`k6'           `athlon'                      
               `sledgehammer'                
`.mmx' `.sse'                                
`.sse2'                                      
`.sse3'                                      
`.3dnow'                                     

   Apart from the warning, there are only two other effects on `as'
operation;  Firstly, if you specify a CPU other than `i486', then shift
by one instructions such as `sarl $1, %eax' will automatically use a
two byte opcode sequence.  The larger three byte opcode sequence is
used on the 486 (and when no architecture is specified) because it
executes faster on the 486.  Note that you can explicitly request the
two byte opcode by writing `sarl %eax'.  Secondly, if you specify
`i8086', `i186', or `i286', _and_ `.code16' or `.code16gcc' then byte
offset conditional jumps will be promoted when necessary to a two
instruction sequence consisting of a conditional jump of the opposite
sense around an unconditional jump to the target.

   Following the CPU architecture (but not a sub-architecture, which
are those starting with a dot), you may specify `jumps' or `nojumps' to
control automatic promotion of conditional jumps. `jumps' is the
default, and enables jump promotion;  All external jumps will be of the
long variety, and file-local jumps will be promoted as necessary.
(*note i386-Jumps::)  `nojumps' leaves external conditional jumps as
byte offset jumps, and warns about file-local conditional jumps that
`as' promotes.  Unconditional jumps are treated as for `jumps'.

   For example

      .arch i8086,nojumps

8.11.13 Notes
-------------

There is some trickery concerning the `mul' and `imul' instructions
that deserves mention.  The 16-, 32-, 64- and 128-bit expanding
multiplies (base opcode `0xf6'; extension 4 for `mul' and 5 for `imul')
can be output only in the one operand form.  Thus, `imul %ebx, %eax'
does _not_ select the expanding multiply; the expanding multiply would
clobber the `%edx' register, and this would confuse `gcc' output.  Use
`imul %ebx' to get the 64-bit product in `%edx:%eax'.

   We have added a two operand form of `imul' when the first operand is
an immediate mode expression and the second operand is a register.
This is just a shorthand, so that, multiplying `%eax' by 69, for
example, can be done with `imul $69, %eax' rather than `imul $69, %eax,
%eax'.

8.12.1 i860 Notes
-----------------

This is a fairly complete i860 assembler which is compatible with the
UNIX System V/860 Release 4 assembler. However, it does not currently
support SVR4 PIC (i.e., `@@GOT, @@GOTOFF, @@PLT').

   Like the SVR4/860 assembler, the output object format is ELF32.
Currently, this is the only supported object format. If there is
sufficient interest, other formats such as COFF may be implemented.

   Both the Intel and AT&T/SVR4 syntaxes are supported, with the latter
being the default.  One difference is that AT&T syntax requires the '%'
prefix on register names while Intel syntax does not.  Another
difference is in the specification of relocatable expressions.  The
Intel syntax is `ha%expression' whereas the SVR4 syntax is
`[expression]@@ha' (and similarly for the "l" and "h" selectors).

8.12.2 i860 Command-line Options
--------------------------------

8.12.2.1 SVR4 compatibility options
...................................

`-V'
     Print assembler version.

`-Qy'
     Ignored.

`-Qn'
     Ignored.

8.12.2.2 Other options
......................

`-EL'
     Select little endian output (this is the default).

`-EB'
     Select big endian output. Note that the i860 always reads
     instructions as little endian data, so this option only effects
     data and not instructions.

`-mwarn-expand'
     Emit a warning message if any pseudo-instruction expansions
     occurred.  For example, a `or' instruction with an immediate
     larger than 16-bits will be expanded into two instructions. This
     is a very undesirable feature to rely on, so this flag can help
     detect any code where it happens. One use of it, for instance, has
     been to find and eliminate any place where `gcc' may emit these
     pseudo-instructions.

`-mxp'
     Enable support for the i860XP instructions and control registers.
     By default, this option is disabled so that only the base
     instruction set (i.e., i860XR) is supported.

`-mintel-syntax'
     The i860 assembler defaults to AT&T/SVR4 syntax.  This option
     enables the Intel syntax.

8.12.3 i860 Machine Directives
------------------------------

`.dual'
     Enter dual instruction mode. While this directive is supported, the
     preferred way to use dual instruction mode is to explicitly code
     the dual bit with the `d.' prefix.

`.enddual'
     Exit dual instruction mode. While this directive is supported, the
     preferred way to use dual instruction mode is to explicitly code
     the dual bit with the `d.' prefix.

`.atmp'
     Change the temporary register used when expanding pseudo
     operations. The default register is `r31'.

   The `.dual', `.enddual', and `.atmp' directives are available only
in the Intel syntax mode.

   Both syntaxes allow for the standard `.align' directive.  However,
the Intel syntax additionally allows keywords for the alignment
parameter: "`.align type'", where `type' is one of `.short', `.long',
`.quad', `.single', `.double' representing alignments of 2, 4, 16, 4,
and 8, respectively.

8.12.4 i860 Opcodes
-------------------

All of the Intel i860XR and i860XP machine instructions are supported.
Please see either _i860 Microprocessor Programmer's Reference Manual_
or _i860 Microprocessor Architecture_ for more information.

8.12.4.1 Other instruction support (pseudo-instructions)
........................................................

For compatibility with some other i860 assemblers, a number of
pseudo-instructions are supported. While these are supported, they are
a very undesirable feature that should be avoided - in particular, when
they result in an expansion to multiple actual i860 instructions. Below
are the pseudo-instructions that result in expansions.
   * Load large immediate into general register:

     The pseudo-instruction `mov imm,%rn' (where the immediate does not
     fit within a signed 16-bit field) will be expanded into:
          orh large_imm@@h,%r0,%rn
          or large_imm@@l,%rn,%rn

   * Load/store with relocatable address expression:

     For example, the pseudo-instruction `ld.b addr_exp(%rx),%rn' will
     be expanded into:
          orh addr_exp@@ha,%rx,%r31
          ld.l addr_exp@@l(%r31),%rn

     The analogous expansions apply to `ld.x, st.x, fld.x, pfld.x,
     fst.x', and `pst.x' as well.

   * Signed large immediate with add/subtract:

     If any of the arithmetic operations `adds, addu, subs, subu' are
     used with an immediate larger than 16-bits (signed), then they
     will be expanded.  For instance, the pseudo-instruction `adds
     large_imm,%rx,%rn' expands to:
          orh large_imm@@h,%r0,%r31
          or large_imm@@l,%r31,%r31
          adds %r31,%rx,%rn

   * Unsigned large immediate with logical operations:

     Logical operations (`or, andnot, or, xor') also result in
     expansions.  The pseudo-instruction `or large_imm,%rx,%rn' results
     in:
          orh large_imm@@h,%rx,%r31
          or large_imm@@l,%r31,%rn

     Similarly for the others, except for `and' which expands to:
          andnot (-1 - large_imm)@@h,%rx,%r31
          andnot (-1 - large_imm)@@l,%r31,%rn

File: as.info,  Node: Options-i960,  Next: Floating Point-i960,  Up: i960-Dependent

8.13.1 i960 Command-line Options
--------------------------------

`-ACA | -ACA_A | -ACB | -ACC | -AKA | -AKB | -AKC | -AMC'
     Select the 80960 architecture.  Instructions or features not
     supported by the selected architecture cause fatal errors.

     `-ACA' is equivalent to `-ACA_A'; `-AKC' is equivalent to `-AMC'.
     Synonyms are provided for compatibility with other tools.

     If you do not specify any of these options, `as' generates code
     for any instruction or feature that is supported by _some_ version
     of the 960 (even if this means mixing architectures!).  In
     principle, `as' attempts to deduce the minimal sufficient
     processor type if none is specified; depending on the object code
     format, the processor type may be recorded in the object file.  If
     it is critical that the `as' output match a specific architecture,
     specify that architecture explicitly.

`-b'
     Add code to collect information about conditional branches taken,
     for later optimization using branch prediction bits.  (The
     conditional branch instructions have branch prediction bits in the
     CA, CB, and CC architectures.)  If BR represents a conditional
     branch instruction, the following represents the code generated by
     the assembler when `-b' is specified:

                  call    INCREMENT ROUTINE
                  .word   0       # pre-counter
          Label:  BR
                  call    INCREMENT ROUTINE
                  .word   0       # post-counter

     The counter following a branch records the number of times that
     branch was _not_ taken; the differenc between the two counters is
     the number of times the branch _was_ taken.

     A table of every such `Label' is also generated, so that the
     external postprocessor `gbr960' (supplied by Intel) can locate all
     the counters.  This table is always labeled `__BRANCH_TABLE__';
     this is a local symbol to permit collecting statistics for many
     separate object files.  The table is word aligned, and begins with
     a two-word header.  The first word, initialized to 0, is used in
     maintaining linked lists of branch tables.  The second word is a
     count of the number of entries in the table, which follow
     immediately: each is a word, pointing to one of the labels
     illustrated above.

           +------------+------------+------------+ ... +------------+
           |            |            |            |     |            |
           |  *NEXT     |  COUNT: N  | *BRLAB 1   |     | *BRLAB N   |
           |            |            |            |     |            |
           +------------+------------+------------+ ... +------------+

                         __BRANCH_TABLE__ layout

     The first word of the header is used to locate multiple branch
     tables, since each object file may contain one. Normally the links
     are maintained with a call to an initialization routine, placed at
     the beginning of each function in the file.  The GNU C compiler
     generates these calls automatically when you give it a `-b' option.
     For further details, see the documentation of `gbr960'.

`-no-relax'
     Normally, Compare-and-Branch instructions with targets that require
     displacements greater than 13 bits (or that have external targets)
     are replaced with the corresponding compare (or `chkbit') and
     branch instructions.  You can use the `-no-relax' option to
     specify that `as' should generate errors instead, if the target
     displacement is larger than 13 bits.

     This option does not affect the Compare-and-Jump instructions; the
     code emitted for them is _always_ adjusted when necessary
     (depending on displacement size), regardless of whether you use
     `-no-relax'.

8.13.3 i960 Machine Directives
------------------------------

`.bss SYMBOL, LENGTH, ALIGN'
     Reserve LENGTH bytes in the bss section for a local SYMBOL,
     aligned to the power of two specified by ALIGN.  LENGTH and ALIGN
     must be positive absolute expressions.  This directive differs
     from `.lcomm' only in that it permits you to specify an alignment.
     *Note `.lcomm': Lcomm.

`.extended FLONUMS'
     `.extended' expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas; for
     each flonum, `.extended' emits an IEEE extended-format (80-bit)
     floating-point number.

`.leafproc CALL-LAB, BAL-LAB'
     You can use the `.leafproc' directive in conjunction with the
     optimized `callj' instruction to enable faster calls of leaf
     procedures.  If a procedure is known to call no other procedures,
     you may define an entry point that skips procedure prolog code
     (and that does not depend on system-supplied saved context), and
     declare it as the BAL-LAB using `.leafproc'.  If the procedure
     also has an entry point that goes through the normal prolog, you
     can specify that entry point as CALL-LAB.

     A `.leafproc' declaration is meant for use in conjunction with the
     optimized call instruction `callj'; the directive records the data
     needed later to choose between converting the `callj' into a `bal'
     or a `call'.

     CALL-LAB is optional; if only one argument is present, or if the
     two arguments are identical, the single argument is assumed to be
     the `bal' entry point.

`.sysproc NAME, INDEX'
     The `.sysproc' directive defines a name for a system procedure.
     After you define it using `.sysproc', you can use NAME to refer to
     the system procedure identified by INDEX when calling procedures
     with the optimized call instruction `callj'.

     Both arguments are required; INDEX must be between 0 and 31
     (inclusive).

corresponding instruction: `callj', and Compare-and-Branch or
Compare-and-Jump instructions with target displacements larger than 13
bits.

8.13.4.1 `callj'
................

You can write `callj' to have the assembler or the linker determine the
most appropriate form of subroutine call: `call', `bal', or `calls'.
If the assembly source contains enough information--a `.leafproc' or
`.sysproc' directive defining the operand--then `as' translates the
`callj'; if not, it simply emits the `callj', leaving it for the linker
to resolve.


File: as.info,  Node: Compare-and-branch-i960,  Prev: callj-i960,  Up: Opcodes for i960

8.13.4.2 Compare-and-Branch
...........................

The 960 architectures provide combined Compare-and-Branch instructions
that permit you to store the branch target in the lower 13 bits of the
instruction word itself.  However, if you specify a branch target far
enough away that its address won't fit in 13 bits, the assembler can
either issue an error, or convert your Compare-and-Branch instruction
into separate instructions to do the compare and the branch.

   Whether `as' gives an error or expands the instruction depends on
two choices you can make: whether you use the `-no-relax' option, and
whether you use a "Compare and Branch" instruction or a "Compare and
Jump" instruction.  The "Jump" instructions are _always_ expanded if
necessary; the "Branch" instructions are expanded when necessary
_unless_ you specify `-no-relax'--in which case `as' gives an error
instead.

   These are the Compare-and-Branch instructions, their "Jump" variants,
and the instruction pairs they may expand into:

             Compare and
          Branch      Jump       Expanded to

File: as.info,  Node: IA-64 Options,  Next: IA-64 Syntax,  Up: IA-64-Dependent

8.14.1 Options
--------------

`-mconstant-gp'
     This option instructs the assembler to mark the resulting object
     file as using the "constant GP" model.  With this model, it is
     assumed that the entire program uses a single global pointer (GP)
     value.  Note that this option does not in any fashion affect the
     machine code emitted by the assembler.  All it does is turn on the
     EF_IA_64_CONS_GP flag in the ELF file header.

`-mauto-pic'
     This option instructs the assembler to mark the resulting object
     file as using the "constant GP without function descriptor" data
     model.  This model is like the "constant GP" model, except that it
     additionally does away with function descriptors.  What this means
     is that the address of a function refers directly to the
     function's code entry-point.  Normally, such an address would
     refer to a function descriptor, which contains both the code
     entry-point and the GP-value needed by the function.  Note that
     this option does not in any fashion affect the machine code
     emitted by the assembler.  All it does is turn on the
     EF_IA_64_NOFUNCDESC_CONS_GP flag in the ELF file header.

`-milp32'

`-milp64'

`-mlp64'

`-mp64'
     These options select the data model.  The assembler defaults to
     `-mlp64' (LP64 data model).

`-mle'

`-mbe'
     These options select the byte order.  The `-mle' option selects
     little-endian byte order (default) and `-mbe' selects big-endian
     byte order.  Note that IA-64 machine code always uses
     little-endian byte order.

`-mtune=itanium1'

`-mtune=itanium2'
     Tune for a particular IA-64 CPU, ITANIUM1 or ITANIUM2. The default
     is ITANIUM2.

`-munwind-check=warning'

`-munwind-check=error'
     These options control what the assembler will do when performing
     consistency checks on unwind directives.  `-munwind-check=warning'
     will make the assembler issue a warning when an unwind directive
     check fails.  This is the default.  `-munwind-check=error' will
     make the assembler issue an error when an unwind directive check
     fails.

`-mhint.b=ok'

`-mhint.b=warning'

`-mhint.b=error'
     These options control what the assembler will do when the `hint.b'
     instruction is used.  `-mhint.b=ok' will make the assembler accept
     `hint.b'.  `-mint.b=warning' will make the assembler issue a
     warning when `hint.b' is used.  `-mhint.b=error' will make the
     assembler treat `hint.b' as an error, which is the default.

`-x'

`-xexplicit'
     These options turn on dependency violation checking.

`-xauto'
     This option instructs the assembler to automatically insert stop
     bits where necessary to remove dependency violations.  This is the
     default mode.

`-xnone'
     This option turns off dependency violation checking.

`-xdebug'
     This turns on debug output intended to help tracking down bugs in
     the dependency violation checker.

`-xdebugn'
     This is a shortcut for -xnone -xdebug.

`-xdebugx'
     This is a shortcut for -xexplicit -xdebug.

The 128 integer registers are referred to as `rN'.  The 128
floating-point registers are referred to as `fN'.  The 128 application
registers are referred to as `arN'.  The 128 control registers are
referred to as `crN'.  The 64 one-bit predicate registers are referred
to as `pN'.  The 8 branch registers are referred to as `bN'.  In
addition, the assembler defines a number of aliases: `gp' (`r1'), `sp'
(`r12'), `rp' (`b0'), `ret0' (`r8'), `ret1' (`r9'), `ret2' (`r10'),
`ret3' (`r9'), `fargN' (`f8+N'), and `fretN' (`f8+N').

   For convenience, the assembler also defines aliases for all named
application and control registers.  For example, `ar.bsp' refers to the
register backing store pointer (`ar17').  Similarly, `cr.eoi' refers to
the end-of-interrupt register (`cr67').

value of 0x2000.  These masks are primarily intended for use with the
`ssm'/`sum' and `rsm'/`rum' instructions, but they can be used anywhere
else where an integer constant is expected.

8.16.2 Symbolic Operand Modifiers
---------------------------------

The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses in
M32C instruction operands.  The general syntax is the following:

     %modifier(symbol)

`%dsp8'
`%dsp16'
     These modifiers override the assembler's assumptions about how big
     a symbol's address is.  Normally, when it sees an operand like
     `sym[a0]' it assumes `sym' may require the widest displacement
     field (16 bits for `-m16c', 24 bits for `-m32c').  These modifiers
     tell it to assume the address will fit in an 8 or 16 bit
     (respectively) unsigned displacement.  Note that, of course, if it
     doesn't actually fit you will get linker errors.  Example:

          mov.w %dsp8(sym)[a0],r1
          mov.b #0,%dsp8(sym)[a0]

`%hi8'
     This modifier allows you to load bits 16 through 23 of a 24 bit
     address into an 8 bit register.  This is useful with, for example,
     the M16C `smovf' instruction, which expects a 20 bit address in
     `r1h' and `a0'.  Example:

          mov.b #%hi8(sym),r1h
          mov.w #%lo16(sym),a0
          smovf.b

`%lo16'
     Likewise, this modifier allows you to load bits 0 through 15 of a
     24 bit address into a 16 bit register.

`%hi16'
     This modifier allows you to load bits 16 through 31 of a 32 bit
     address into a 16 bit register.  While the M32C family only has 24
     bits of address space, it does support addresses in pairs of 16 bit
     registers (like `a1a0' for the `lde' instruction).  This modifier
     is for loading the upper half in such cases.  Example:

          mov.w #%hi16(sym),a1
          mov.w #%lo16(sym),a0
          ...
          lde.w [a1a0],r1

8.17.1 M32R Options
-------------------

The Renease M32R version of `as' has a few machine dependent options:

`-m32rx'
     `as' can assemble code for several different members of the
     Renesas M32R family.  Normally the default is to assemble code for
     the M32R microprocessor.  This option may be used to change the
     default to the M32RX microprocessor, which adds some more
     instructions to the basic M32R instruction set, and some
     additional parameters to some of the original instructions.

`-m32r2'
     This option changes the target processor to the the M32R2
     microprocessor.

`-m32r'
     This option can be used to restore the assembler's default
     behaviour of assembling for the M32R microprocessor.  This can be
     useful if the default has been changed by a previous command line
     option.

`-little'
     This option tells the assembler to produce little-endian code and
     data.  The default is dependent upon how the toolchain was
     configured.

`-EL'
     This is a synonum for _-little_.

`-big'
     This option tells the assembler to produce big-endian code and
     data.

`-EB'
     This is a synonum for _-big_.

`-KPIC'
     This option specifies that the output of the assembler should be
     marked as position-independent code (PIC).

`-parallel'
     This option tells the assembler to attempts to combine two
     sequential instructions into a single, parallel instruction, where
     it is legal to do so.

`-no-parallel'
     This option disables a previously enabled _-parallel_ option.

`-no-bitinst'
     This option disables the support for the extended bit-field
     instructions provided by the M32R2.  If this support needs to be
     re-enabled the _-bitinst_ switch can be used to restore it.

`-O'
     This option tells the assembler to attempt to optimize the
     instructions that it produces.  This includes filling delay slots
     and converting sequential instructions into parallel ones.  This
     option implies _-parallel_.

`-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts'
     Instructs `as' to produce warning messages when questionable
     parallel instructions are encountered.  This option is enabled by
     default, but `gcc' disables it when it invokes `as' directly.
     Questionable instructions are those whoes behaviour would be
     different if they were executed sequentially.  For example the
     code fragment `mv r1, r2 || mv r3, r1' produces a different result
     from `mv r1, r2 \n mv r3, r1' since the former moves r1 into r3
     and then r2 into r1, whereas the later moves r2 into r1 and r3.

`-Wp'
     This is a shorter synonym for the
     _-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts_ option.

`-no-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts'
     Instructs `as' not to produce warning messages when questionable
     parallel instructions are encountered.

`-Wnp'
     This is a shorter synonym for the
     _-no-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts_ option.

`-ignore-parallel-conflicts'
     This option tells the assembler's to stop checking parallel
     instructions for contraint violations.  This ability is provided
     for hardware vendors testing chip designs and should not be used
     under normal circumstances.

`-no-ignore-parallel-conflicts'
     This option restores the assembler's default behaviour of checking
     parallel instructions to detect constraint violations.

`-Ip'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-ignore-parallel-conflicts_
     option.

`-nIp'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-no-ignore-parallel-conflicts_
     option.

`-warn-unmatched-high'
     This option tells the assembler to produce a warning message if a
     `.high' pseudo op is encountered without a mathcing `.low' pseudo
     op.  The presence of such an unmatches pseudo op usually indicates
     a programming error.

`-no-warn-unmatched-high'
     Disables a previously enabled _-warn-unmatched-high_ option.

`-Wuh'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-warn-unmatched-high_ option.

`-Wnuh'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-no-warn-unmatched-high_ option.

8.17.2 M32R Directives
----------------------

The Renease M32R version of `as' has a few architecture specific
directives:

`low EXPRESSION'
     The `low' directive computes the value of its expression and
     places the lower 16-bits of the result into the immediate-field of
     the instruction.  For example:

             or3   r0, r0, #low(0x12345678) ; compute r0 = r0 | 0x5678
             add3, r0, r0, #low(fred)   ; compute r0 = r0 + low 16-bits of address of fred

`high EXPRESSION'
     The `high' directive computes the value of its expression and
     places the upper 16-bits of the result into the immediate-field of
     the instruction.  For example:

             seth  r0, #high(0x12345678) ; compute r0 = 0x12340000
             seth, r0, #high(fred)       ; compute r0 = upper 16-bits of address of fred

`shigh EXPRESSION'
     The `shigh' directive is very similar to the `high' directive.  It
     also computes the value of its expression and places the upper
     16-bits of the result into the immediate-field of the instruction.
     The difference is that `shigh' also checks to see if the lower
     16-bits could be interpreted as a signed number, and if so it
     assumes that a borrow will occur from the upper-16 bits.  To
     compensate for this the `shigh' directive pre-biases the upper 16
     bit value by adding one to it.  For example:

     For example:

             seth  r0, #shigh(0x12345678) ; compute r0 = 0x12340000
             seth  r0, #shigh(0x00008000) ; compute r0 = 0x00010000

     In the second example the lower 16-bits are 0x8000.  If these are
     treated as a signed value and sign extended to 32-bits then the
     value becomes 0xffff8000.  If this value is then added to
     0x00010000 then the result is 0x00008000.

     This behaviour is to allow for the different semantics of the
     `or3' and `add3' instructions.  The `or3' instruction treats its
     16-bit immediate argument as unsigned whereas the `add3' treats
     its 16-bit immediate as a signed value.  So for example:

             seth  r0, #shigh(0x00008000)
             add3  r0, r0, #low(0x00008000)

     Produces the correct result in r0, whereas:

             seth  r0, #shigh(0x00008000)
             or3   r0, r0, #low(0x00008000)

     Stores 0xffff8000 into r0.

     Note - the `shigh' directive does not know where in the assembly
     source code the lower 16-bits of the value are going set, so it
     cannot check to make sure that an `or3' instruction is being used
     rather than an `add3' instruction.  It is up to the programmer to
     make sure that correct directives are used.

`.m32r'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-m32r_ command line
     option.  It tells the assembler to only accept M32R instructions
     from now on.  An instructions from later M32R architectures are
     refused.

`.m32rx'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-m32rx_ command
     line option.  It tells the assembler to start accepting the extra
     instructions in the M32RX ISA as well as the ordinary M32R ISA.

`.m32r2'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-m32r2_ command
     line option.  It tells the assembler to start accepting the extra
     instructions in the M32R2 ISA as well as the ordinary M32R ISA.

`.little'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-little_ command
     line option.  It tells the assembler to start producing
     little-endian code and data.  This option should be used with care
     as producing mixed-endian binary files is frought with danger.

`.big'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-big_ command line
     option.  It tells the assembler to start producing big-endian code
     and data.  This option should be used with care as producing
     mixed-endian binary files is frought with danger.

8.17.3 M32R Warnings
--------------------

There are several warning and error messages that can be produced by
`as' which are specific to the M32R:

`output of 1st instruction is the same as an input to 2nd instruction - is this intentional ?'
     This message is only produced if warnings for explicit parallel
     conflicts have been enabled.  It indicates that the assembler has
     encountered a parallel instruction in which the destination
     register of the left hand instruction is used as an input register
     in the right hand instruction.  For example in this code fragment
     `mv r1, r2 || neg r3, r1' register r1 is the destination of the
     move instruction and the input to the neg instruction.

`output of 2nd instruction is the same as an input to 1st instruction - is this intentional ?'
     This message is only produced if warnings for explicit parallel
     conflicts have been enabled.  It indicates that the assembler has
     encountered a parallel instruction in which the destination
     register of the right hand instruction is used as an input
     register in the left hand instruction.  For example in this code
     fragment `mv r1, r2 || neg r2, r3' register r2 is the destination
     of the neg instruction and the input to the move instruction.

`instruction `...' is for the M32RX only'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters an
     instruction which is only supported by the M32Rx processor, and
     the `-m32rx' command line flag has not been specified to allow
     assembly of such instructions.

`unknown instruction `...''
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters an
     instruction which it does not recognise.

`only the NOP instruction can be issued in parallel on the m32r'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction which does not involve a NOP instruction and the
     `-m32rx' command line flag has not been specified.  Only the M32Rx
     processor is able to execute two instructions in parallel.

`instruction `...' cannot be executed in parallel.'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction which is made up of one or two instructions which
     cannot be executed in parallel.

`Instructions share the same execution pipeline'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction whoes components both use the same execution pipeline.

`Instructions write to the same destination register.'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction where both components attempt to modify the same
     register.  For example these code fragments will produce this
     message: `mv r1, r2 || neg r1, r3' `jl r0 || mv r14, r1' `st r2,
     @@-r1 || mv r1, r3' `mv r1, r2 || ld r0, @@r1+' `cmp r1, r2 || addx
     r3, r4' (Both write to the condition bit)

8.18.1 M680x0 Options
---------------------

The Motorola 680x0 version of `as' has a few machine dependent options:

`-march=ARCHITECTURE'
     This option specifies a target architecture.  The following
     architectures are recognized: `68000', `68010', `68020', `68030',
     `68040', `68060', `cpu32', `isaa', `isaaplus', `isab' and `cfv4e'.

`-mcpu=CPU'
     This option specifies a target cpu.  When used in conjunction with
     the `-march' option, the cpu must be within the specified
     architecture.  Also, the generic features of the architecture are
     used for instruction generation, rather than those of the specific
     chip.

`-m[no-]68851'

`-m[no-]68881'

`-m[no-]div'

`-m[no-]usp'

`-m[no-]float'

`-m[no-]mac'

`-m[no-]emac'
     Enable or disable various architecture specific features.  If a
     chip or architecture by default supports an option (for instance
     `-march=isaaplus' includes the `-mdiv' option), explicitly
     disabling the option will override the default.

`-l'
     You can use the `-l' option to shorten the size of references to
     undefined symbols.  If you do not use the `-l' option, references
     to undefined symbols are wide enough for a full `long' (32 bits).
     (Since `as' cannot know where these symbols end up, `as' can only
     allocate space for the linker to fill in later.  Since `as' does
     not know how far away these symbols are, it allocates as much
     space as it can.)  If you use this option, the references are only
     one word wide (16 bits).  This may be useful if you want the
     object file to be as small as possible, and you know that the
     relevant symbols are always less than 17 bits away.

`--register-prefix-optional'
     For some configurations, especially those where the compiler
     normally does not prepend an underscore to the names of user
     variables, the assembler requires a `%' before any use of a
     register name.  This is intended to let the assembler distinguish
     between C variables and functions named `a0' through `a7', and so
     on.  The `%' is always accepted, but is not required for certain
     configurations, notably `sun3'.  The `--register-prefix-optional'
     option may be used to permit omitting the `%' even for
     configurations for which it is normally required.  If this is
     done, it will generally be impossible to refer to C variables and
     functions with the same names as register names.

`--bitwise-or'
     Normally the character `|' is treated as a comment character, which
     means that it can not be used in expressions.  The `--bitwise-or'
     option turns `|' into a normal character.  In this mode, you must
     either use C style comments, or start comments with a `#' character
     at the beginning of a line.

`--base-size-default-16  --base-size-default-32'
     If you use an addressing mode with a base register without
     specifying the size, `as' will normally use the full 32 bit value.
     For example, the addressing mode `%a0@@(%d0)' is equivalent to
     `%a0@@(%d0:l)'.  You may use the `--base-size-default-16' option to
     tell `as' to default to using the 16 bit value.  In this case,
     `%a0@@(%d0)' is equivalent to `%a0@@(%d0:w)'.  You may use the
     `--base-size-default-32' option to restore the default behaviour.

`--disp-size-default-16  --disp-size-default-32'
     If you use an addressing mode with a displacement, and the value
     of the displacement is not known, `as' will normally assume that
     the value is 32 bits.  For example, if the symbol `disp' has not
     been defined, `as' will assemble the addressing mode
     `%a0@@(disp,%d0)' as though `disp' is a 32 bit value.  You may use
     the `--disp-size-default-16' option to tell `as' to instead assume
     that the displacement is 16 bits.  In this case, `as' will
     assemble `%a0@@(disp,%d0)' as though `disp' is a 16 bit value.  You
     may use the `--disp-size-default-32' option to restore the default
     behaviour.

`--pcrel'
     Always keep branches PC-relative.  In the M680x0 architecture all
     branches are defined as PC-relative.  However, on some processors
     they are limited to word displacements maximum.  When `as' needs a
     long branch that is not available, it normally emits an absolute
     jump instead.  This option disables this substitution.  When this
     option is given and no long branches are available, only word
     branches will be emitted.  An error message will be generated if a
     word branch cannot reach its target.  This option has no effect on
     68020 and other processors that have long branches.  *note Branch
     Improvement: M68K-Branch.

`-m68000'
     `as' can assemble code for several different members of the
     Motorola 680x0 family.  The default depends upon how `as' was
     configured when it was built; normally, the default is to assemble
     code for the 68020 microprocessor.  The following options may be
     used to change the default.  These options control which
     instructions and addressing modes are permitted.  The members of
     the 680x0 family are very similar.  For detailed information about
     the differences, see the Motorola manuals.

    `-m68000'
    `-m68ec000'
    `-m68hc000'
    `-m68hc001'
    `-m68008'
    `-m68302'
    `-m68306'
    `-m68307'
    `-m68322'
    `-m68356'
          Assemble for the 68000. `-m68008', `-m68302', and so on are
          synonyms for `-m68000', since the chips are the same from the
          point of view of the assembler.

    `-m68010'
          Assemble for the 68010.

    `-m68020'
    `-m68ec020'
          Assemble for the 68020.  This is normally the default.

    `-m68030'
    `-m68ec030'
          Assemble for the 68030.

    `-m68040'
    `-m68ec040'
          Assemble for the 68040.

    `-m68060'
    `-m68ec060'
          Assemble for the 68060.

    `-mcpu32'
    `-m68330'
    `-m68331'
    `-m68332'
    `-m68333'
    `-m68334'
    `-m68336'
    `-m68340'
    `-m68341'
    `-m68349'
    `-m68360'
          Assemble for the CPU32 family of chips.

    `-m5200'

    `-m5202'

    `-m5204'

    `-m5206'

    `-m5206e'

    `-m521x'

    `-m5249'

    `-m528x'

    `-m5307'

    `-m5407'

    `-m547x'

    `-m548x'

    `-mcfv4'

    `-mcfv4e'
          Assemble for the ColdFire family of chips.

    `-m68881'
    `-m68882'
          Assemble 68881 floating point instructions.  This is the
          default for the 68020, 68030, and the CPU32.  The 68040 and
          68060 always support floating point instructions.

    `-mno-68881'
          Do not assemble 68881 floating point instructions.  This is
          the default for 68000 and the 68010.  The 68040 and 68060
          always support floating point instructions, even if this
          option is used.

    `-m68851'
          Assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default for the
          68020, 68030, and 68060.  The 68040 accepts a somewhat
          different set of MMU instructions; `-m68851' and `-m68040'
          should not be used together.

    `-mno-68851'
          Do not assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default
          for the 68000, 68010, and the CPU32.  The 68040 accepts a
          somewhat different set of MMU instructions.

8.18.2 Syntax
-------------

This syntax for the Motorola 680x0 was developed at MIT.

   The 680x0 version of `as' uses instructions names and syntax
compatible with the Sun assembler.  Intervening periods are ignored;
for example, `movl' is equivalent to `mov.l'.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
(`%a0' through `%a7'), the program counter (`%pc'), the zero-address
relative to the program counter (`%zpc'), a suppressed address register
(`%za0' through `%za7'), or it may be omitted entirely.  The use of
SIZE means one of `w' or `l', and it may be omitted, along with the
leading colon, unless a scale is also specified.  The use of SCALE
means one of `1', `2', `4', or `8', and it may always be omitted along
with the leading colon.

   The following addressing modes are understood:
"Immediate"
     `#NUMBER'

"Data Register"
     `%d0' through `%d7'

"Address Register"
     `%a0' through `%a7'
     `%a7' is also known as `%sp', i.e. the Stack Pointer.  `%a6' is
     also known as `%fp', the Frame Pointer.

"Address Register Indirect"
     `%a0@@' through `%a7@@'

"Address Register Postincrement"
     `%a0@@+' through `%a7@@+'

"Address Register Predecrement"
     `%a0@@-' through `%a7@@-'

"Indirect Plus Offset"
     `APC@@(NUMBER)'

"Index"
     `APC@@(NUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted.

"Postindex"
     `APC@@(NUMBER)@@(ONUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)'

     The ONUMBER or the REGISTER, but not both, may be omitted.

"Preindex"
     `APC@@(NUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)@@(ONUMBER)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted.  Omitting the REGISTER produces the
     Postindex addressing mode.

"Absolute"
     `SYMBOL', or `DIGITS', optionally followed by `:b', `:w', or `:l'.

8.18.3 Motorola Syntax
----------------------

The standard Motorola syntax for this chip differs from the syntax
already discussed (*note Syntax: M68K-Syntax.).  `as' can accept
Motorola syntax for operands, even if MIT syntax is used for other
operands in the same instruction.  The two kinds of syntax are fully
compatible.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
(`%a0' through `%a7'), the program counter (`%pc'), the zero-address
relative to the program counter (`%zpc'), or a suppressed address
register (`%za0' through `%za7').  The use of SIZE means one of `w' or
`l', and it may always be omitted along with the leading dot.  The use
of SCALE means one of `1', `2', `4', or `8', and it may always be
omitted along with the leading asterisk.

   The following additional addressing modes are understood:

"Address Register Indirect"
     `(%a0)' through `(%a7)'
     `%a7' is also known as `%sp', i.e. the Stack Pointer.  `%a6' is
     also known as `%fp', the Frame Pointer.

"Address Register Postincrement"
     `(%a0)+' through `(%a7)+'

"Address Register Predecrement"
     `-(%a0)' through `-(%a7)'

"Indirect Plus Offset"
     `NUMBER(%A0)' through `NUMBER(%A7)', or `NUMBER(%PC)'.

     The NUMBER may also appear within the parentheses, as in
     `(NUMBER,%A0)'.  When used with the PC, the NUMBER may be omitted
     (with an address register, omitting the NUMBER produces Address
     Register Indirect mode).

"Index"
     `NUMBER(APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted, or it may appear within the
     parentheses.  The APC may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC
     may appear in either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address
     registers, and the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first
     register is taken as the base register, and the second as the
     index register.

"Postindex"
     `([NUMBER,APC],REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE,ONUMBER)'

     The ONUMBER, or the REGISTER, or both, may be omitted.  Either the
     NUMBER or the APC may be omitted, but not both.

"Preindex"
     `([NUMBER,APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE],ONUMBER)'

     The NUMBER, or the APC, or the REGISTER, or any two of them, may
     be omitted.  The ONUMBER may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC
     may appear in either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address
     registers, and the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first
     register is taken as the base register, and the second as the
     index register.

8.18.5 680x0 Machine Directives
-------------------------------

In order to be compatible with the Sun assembler the 680x0 assembler
understands the following directives.

`.data1'
     This directive is identical to a `.data 1' directive.

`.data2'
     This directive is identical to a `.data 2' directive.

`.even'
     This directive is a special case of the `.align' directive; it
     aligns the output to an even byte boundary.

`.skip'
     This directive is identical to a `.space' directive.

`.arch NAME'
     Select the target architecture and extension features.  Valid
     valuse for NAME are the same as for the `-march' command line
     option.  This directive cannot be specified after any instructions
     have been assembled.  If it is given multiple times, or in
     conjuction with the `-march' option, all uses must be for the same
     architecture and extension set.

`.cpu NAME'
     Select the target cpu.  Valid valuse for NAME are the same as for
     the `-mcpu' command line option.  This directive cannot be
     specified after any instructions have been assembled.  If it is
     given multiple times, or in conjuction with the `-mopt' option,
     all uses must be for the same cpu.

8.18.6.1 Branch Improvement
...........................

Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted for branch instructions.  They
expand to the shortest branch instruction that reach the target.
Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting `j' for `b' at the
start of a Motorola mnemonic.

   The following table summarizes the pseudo-operations.  A `*' flags
cases that are more fully described after the table:

               Displacement
               +------------------------------------------------------------
               |                68020           68000/10, not PC-relative OK
     Pseudo-Op |BYTE    WORD    LONG            ABSOLUTE LONG JUMP    **
               +------------------------------------------------------------
          jbsr |bsrs    bsrw    bsrl            jsr
           jra |bras    braw    bral            jmp

     *    dbXX | N/A    dbXXw   dbXX;bras;bral  dbXX;bras;jmp
          fjXX | N/A    fbXXw   fbXXl            N/A

     XX: condition
     NX: negative of condition XX
                       `*'--see full description below
         `**'--this expansion mode is disallowed by `--pcrel'

`jbsr'
`jra'
     These are the simplest jump pseudo-operations; they always map to
     one particular machine instruction, depending on the displacement
     to the branch target.  This instruction will be a byte or word
     branch is that is sufficient.  Otherwise, a long branch will be
     emitted if available.  If no long branches are available and the
     `--pcrel' option is not given, an absolute long jump will be
     emitted instead.  If no long branches are available, the `--pcrel'
     option is given, and a word branch cannot reach the target, an
     error message is generated.

     In addition to standard branch operands, `as' allows these
     pseudo-operations to have all operands that are allowed for jsr
     and jmp, substituting these instructions if the operand given is
     not valid for a branch instruction.

`jXX'
     Here, `jXX' stands for an entire family of pseudo-operations,
     where XX is a conditional branch or condition-code test.  The full
     list of pseudo-ops in this family is:
           jhi   jls   jcc   jcs   jne   jeq   jvc
           jvs   jpl   jmi   jge   jlt   jgt   jle

     Usually, each of these pseudo-operations expands to a single branch
     instruction.  However, if a word branch is not sufficient, no long
     branches are available, and the `--pcrel' option is not given, `as'
     issues a longer code fragment in terms of NX, the opposite
     condition to XX.  For example, under these conditions:
              jXX foo
     gives
               bNXs oof
               jmp foo
           oof:

`dbXX'
     The full family of pseudo-operations covered here is
           dbhi   dbls   dbcc   dbcs   dbne   dbeq   dbvc
           dbvs   dbpl   dbmi   dbge   dblt   dbgt   dble
           dbf    dbra   dbt

     Motorola `dbXX' instructions allow word displacements only.  When
     a word displacement is sufficient, each of these pseudo-operations
     expands to the corresponding Motorola instruction.  When a word
     displacement is not sufficient and long branches are available,
     when the source reads `dbXX foo', `as' emits
               dbXX oo1
               bras oo2
           oo1:bral foo
           oo2:

     If, however, long branches are not available and the `--pcrel'
     option is not given, `as' emits
               dbXX oo1
               bras oo2
           oo1:jmp foo
           oo2:

`fjXX'
     This family includes
           fjne   fjeq   fjge   fjlt   fjgt   fjle   fjf
           fjt    fjgl   fjgle  fjnge  fjngl  fjngle fjngt
           fjnle  fjnlt  fjoge  fjogl  fjogt  fjole  fjolt
           fjor   fjseq  fjsf   fjsne  fjst   fjueq  fjuge
           fjugt  fjule  fjult  fjun

     Each of these pseudo-operations always expands to a single Motorola
     coprocessor branch instruction, word or long.  All Motorola
     coprocessor branch instructions allow both word and long
     displacements.

...........................

The immediate character is `#' for Sun compatibility.  The line-comment
character is `|' (unless the `--bitwise-or' option is used).  If a `#'
appears at the beginning of a line, it is treated as a comment unless
it looks like `# line file', in which case it is treated normally.

8.19.1 M68HC11 and M68HC12 Options
----------------------------------

The Motorola 68HC11 and 68HC12 version of `as' have a few machine
dependent options.

`-m68hc11'
     This option switches the assembler in the M68HC11 mode. In this
     mode, the assembler only accepts 68HC11 operands and mnemonics. It
     produces code for the 68HC11.

`-m68hc12'
     This option switches the assembler in the M68HC12 mode. In this
     mode, the assembler also accepts 68HC12 operands and mnemonics. It
     produces code for the 68HC12. A few 68HC11 instructions are
     replaced by some 68HC12 instructions as recommended by Motorola
     specifications.

`-m68hcs12'
     This option switches the assembler in the M68HCS12 mode.  This
     mode is similar to `-m68hc12' but specifies to assemble for the
     68HCS12 series.  The only difference is on the assembling of the
     `movb' and `movw' instruction when a PC-relative operand is used.

`-mshort'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 16-bit integer
     ABI.  It has no effect on the assembled instructions.  This is the
     default.

`-mlong'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit integer
     ABI.

`-mshort-double'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit float
     ABI.  This is the default.

`-mlong-double'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 64-bit float
     ABI.

`--strict-direct-mode'
     You can use the `--strict-direct-mode' option to disable the
     automatic translation of direct page mode addressing into extended
     mode when the instruction does not support direct mode.  For
     example, the `clr' instruction does not support direct page mode
     addressing. When it is used with the direct page mode, `as' will
     ignore it and generate an absolute addressing.  This option
     prevents `as' from doing this, and the wrong usage of the direct
     page mode will raise an error.

`--short-branchs'
     The `--short-branchs' option turns off the translation of relative
     branches into absolute branches when the branch offset is out of
     range. By default `as' transforms the relative branch (`bsr',
     `bgt', `bge', `beq', `bne', `ble', `blt', `bhi', `bcc', `bls',
     `bcs', `bmi', `bvs', `bvs', `bra') into an absolute branch when
     the offset is out of the -128 .. 127 range.  In that case, the
     `bsr' instruction is translated into a `jsr', the `bra'
     instruction is translated into a `jmp' and the conditional branchs
     instructions are inverted and followed by a `jmp'. This option
     disables these translations and `as' will generate an error if a
     relative branch is out of range. This option does not affect the
     optimization associated to the `jbra', `jbsr' and `jbXX' pseudo
     opcodes.

`--force-long-branchs'
     The `--force-long-branchs' option forces the translation of
     relative branches into absolute branches. This option does not
     affect the optimization associated to the `jbra', `jbsr' and
     `jbXX' pseudo opcodes.

`--print-insn-syntax'
     You can use the `--print-insn-syntax' option to obtain the syntax
     description of the instruction when an error is detected.

`--print-opcodes'
     The `--print-opcodes' option prints the list of all the
     instructions with their syntax. The first item of each line
     represents the instruction name and the rest of the line indicates
     the possible operands for that instruction. The list is printed in
     alphabetical order. Once the list is printed `as' exits.

`--generate-example'
     The `--generate-example' option is similar to `--print-opcodes'
     but it generates an example for each instruction instead.

8.19.2 Syntax
-------------

In the M68HC11 syntax, the instruction name comes first and it may be
followed by one or several operands (up to three). Operands are
separated by comma (`,'). In the normal mode, `as' will complain if too
many operands are specified for a given instruction. In the MRI mode
(turned on with `-M' option), it will treat them as comments. Example:

     inx
     lda  #23
     bset 2,x #4
     brclr *bot #8 foo

   The following addressing modes are understood for 68HC11 and 68HC12:
"Immediate"
     `#NUMBER'

"Address Register"
     `NUMBER,X', `NUMBER,Y'

     The NUMBER may be omitted in which case 0 is assumed.

"Direct Addressing mode"
     `*SYMBOL', or `*DIGITS'

"Absolute"
     `SYMBOL', or `DIGITS'

   The M68HC12 has other more complex addressing modes. All of them are
supported and they are represented below:

"Constant Offset Indexed Addressing Mode"
     `NUMBER,REG'

     The NUMBER may be omitted in which case 0 is assumed.  The
     register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.  The assembler will
     use the smaller post-byte definition according to the constant
     value (5-bit constant offset, 9-bit constant offset or 16-bit
     constant offset).  If the constant is not known by the assembler
     it will use the 16-bit constant offset post-byte and the value
     will be resolved at link time.

"Offset Indexed Indirect"
     `[NUMBER,REG]'

     The register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.

"Auto Pre-Increment/Pre-Decrement/Post-Increment/Post-Decrement"
     `NUMBER,-REG' `NUMBER,+REG' `NUMBER,REG-' `NUMBER,REG+'

     The number must be in the range `-8'..`+8' and must not be 0.  The
     register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.

"Accumulator Offset"
     `ACC,REG'

     The accumulator register can be either `A', `B' or `D'.  The
     register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.

"Accumulator D offset indexed-indirect"
     `[D,REG]'

     The register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.


   For example:

     ldab 1024,sp
     ldd [10,x]
     orab 3,+x
     stab -2,y-
     ldx a,pc
     sty [d,sp]

8.19.3 Symbolic Operand Modifiers
---------------------------------

The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses in
68HC11 and 68HC12 instruction operands.  The general syntax is the
following:

     %modifier(symbol)

`%addr'
     This modifier indicates to the assembler and linker to use the
     16-bit physical address corresponding to the symbol.  This is
     intended to be used on memory window systems to map a symbol in
     the memory bank window.  If the symbol is in a memory expansion
     part, the physical address corresponds to the symbol address
     within the memory bank window.  If the symbol is not in a memory
     expansion part, this is the symbol address (using or not using the
     %addr modifier has no effect in that case).

`%page'
     This modifier indicates to use the memory page number corresponding
     to the symbol.  If the symbol is in a memory expansion part, its
     page number is computed by the linker as a number used to map the
     page containing the symbol in the memory bank window.  If the
     symbol is not in a memory expansion part, the page number is 0.

`%hi'
     This modifier indicates to use the 8-bit high part of the physical
     address of the symbol.

`%lo'
     This modifier indicates to use the 8-bit low part of the physical
     address of the symbol.


   For example a 68HC12 call to a function `foo_example' stored in
memory expansion part could be written as follows:

     call %addr(foo_example),%page(foo_example)

   and this is equivalent to

     call foo_example

   And for 68HC11 it could be written as follows:

     ldab #%page(foo_example)
     stab _page_switch
     jsr  %addr(foo_example)

8.19.4 Assembler Directives
---------------------------

The 68HC11 and 68HC12 version of `as' have the following specific
assembler directives:

`.relax'
     The relax directive is used by the `GNU Compiler' to emit a
     specific relocation to mark a group of instructions for linker
     relaxation.  The sequence of instructions within the group must be
     known to the linker so that relaxation can be performed.

`.mode [mshort|mlong|mshort-double|mlong-double]'
     This directive specifies the ABI.  It overrides the `-mshort',
     `-mlong', `-mshort-double' and `-mlong-double' options.

`.far SYMBOL'
     This directive marks the symbol as a `far' symbol meaning that it
     uses a `call/rtc' calling convention as opposed to `jsr/rts'.
     During a final link, the linker will identify references to the
     `far' symbol and will verify the proper calling convention.

`.interrupt SYMBOL'
     This directive marks the symbol as an interrupt entry point.  This
     information is then used by the debugger to correctly unwind the
     frame across interrupts.

`.xrefb SYMBOL'
     This directive is defined for compatibility with the
     `Specification for Motorola 8 and 16-Bit Assembly Language Input
     Standard' and is ignored.

8.19.5 Floating Point
---------------------

Packed decimal (P) format floating literals are not supported.  Feel
free to add the code!

   The floating point formats generated by directives are these.

`.float'
     `Single' precision floating point constants.

`.double'
     `Double' precision floating point constants.

`.extend'
`.ldouble'
     `Extended' precision (`long double') floating point constants.

8.19.6.1 Branch Improvement
...........................

Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted for branch instructions.  They
expand to the shortest branch instruction that reach the target.
Generally these mnemonics are made by prepending `j' to the start of
Motorola mnemonic. These pseudo opcodes are not affected by the
`--short-branchs' or `--force-long-branchs' options.

   The following table summarizes the pseudo-operations.

          +--------------------------+----------------------------------+
     XX: condition
     NX: negative of condition XX

`jbsr'
`jbra'
     These are the simplest jump pseudo-operations; they always map to
     one particular machine instruction, depending on the displacement
     to the branch target.

`jbXX'
     Here, `jbXX' stands for an entire family of pseudo-operations,
     where XX is a conditional branch or condition-code test.  The full
     list of pseudo-ops in this family is:
           jbcc   jbeq   jbge   jbgt   jbhi   jbvs   jbpl  jblo
           jbcs   jbne   jblt   jble   jbls   jbvc   jbmi

     For the cases of non-PC relative displacements and long
     displacements, `as' issues a longer code fragment in terms of NX,
     the opposite condition to XX.  For example, for the non-PC
     relative case:
              jbXX foo
     gives
               bNXs oof
               jmp foo
           oof:

8.20 MIPS Dependent Features
============================

   GNU `as' for MIPS architectures supports several different MIPS
processors, and MIPS ISA levels I through V, MIPS32, and MIPS64.  For
information about the MIPS instruction set, see `MIPS RISC
Architecture', by Kane and Heindrich (Prentice-Hall).  For an overview
of MIPS assembly conventions, see "Appendix D: Assembly Language
Programming" in the same work.

8.20.1 Assembler options
------------------------

The MIPS configurations of GNU `as' support these special options:

`-G NUM'
     This option sets the largest size of an object that can be
     referenced implicitly with the `gp' register.  It is only accepted
     for targets that use ECOFF format.  The default value is 8.

`-EB'
`-EL'
     Any MIPS configuration of `as' can select big-endian or
     little-endian output at run time (unlike the other GNU development
     tools, which must be configured for one or the other).  Use `-EB'
     to select big-endian output, and `-EL' for little-endian.

`-mips1'
`-mips2'
`-mips3'
`-mips4'
`-mips5'
`-mips32'
`-mips32r2'
`-mips64'
`-mips64r2'
     Generate code for a particular MIPS Instruction Set Architecture
     level.  `-mips1' corresponds to the R2000 and R3000 processors,
     `-mips2' to the R6000 processor, `-mips3' to the R4000 processor,
     and `-mips4' to the R8000 and R10000 processors.  `-mips5',
     `-mips32', `-mips32r2', `-mips64', and `-mips64r2' correspond to
     generic MIPS V, MIPS32, MIPS32 RELEASE 2, MIPS64, and MIPS64
     RELEASE 2 ISA processors, respectively.  You can also switch
     instruction sets during the assembly; see *Note Directives to
     override the ISA level: MIPS ISA.

`-mgp32'
`-mfp32'
     Some macros have different expansions for 32-bit and 64-bit
     registers.  The register sizes are normally inferred from the ISA
     and ABI, but these flags force a certain group of registers to be
     treated as 32 bits wide at all times.  `-mgp32' controls the size
     of general-purpose registers and `-mfp32' controls the size of
     floating-point registers.

     On some MIPS variants there is a 32-bit mode flag; when this flag
     is set, 64-bit instructions generate a trap.  Also, some 32-bit
     OSes only save the 32-bit registers on a context switch, so it is
     essential never to use the 64-bit registers.

`-mgp64'
     Assume that 64-bit general purpose registers are available.  This
     is provided in the interests of symmetry with -gp32.

`-mips16'
`-no-mips16'
     Generate code for the MIPS 16 processor.  This is equivalent to
     putting `.set mips16' at the start of the assembly file.
     `-no-mips16' turns off this option.

`-mips3d'
`-no-mips3d'
     Generate code for the MIPS-3D Application Specific Extension.
     This tells the assembler to accept MIPS-3D instructions.
     `-no-mips3d' turns off this option.

`-mdmx'
`-no-mdmx'
     Generate code for the MDMX Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MDMX instructions.  `-no-mdmx' turns
     off this option.

`-mdsp'
`-mno-dsp'
     Generate code for the DSP Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept DSP instructions.  `-mno-dsp' turns
     off this option.

`-mmt'
`-mno-mt'
     Generate code for the MT Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MT instructions.  `-mno-mt' turns
     off this option.

`-mfix7000'
`-mno-fix7000'
     Cause nops to be inserted if the read of the destination register
     of an mfhi or mflo instruction occurs in the following two
     instructions.

`-mfix-vr4120'
`-no-mfix-vr4120'
     Insert nops to work around certain VR4120 errata.  This option is
     intended to be used on GCC-generated code: it is not designed to
     catch all problems in hand-written assembler code.

`-mfix-vr4130'
`-no-mfix-vr4130'
     Insert nops to work around the VR4130 `mflo'/`mfhi' errata.

`-m4010'
`-no-m4010'
     Generate code for the LSI R4010 chip.  This tells the assembler to
     accept the R4010 specific instructions (`addciu', `ffc', etc.),
     and to not schedule `nop' instructions around accesses to the `HI'
     and `LO' registers.  `-no-m4010' turns off this option.

`-m4650'
`-no-m4650'
     Generate code for the MIPS R4650 chip.  This tells the assembler
     to accept the `mad' and `madu' instruction, and to not schedule
     `nop' instructions around accesses to the `HI' and `LO' registers.
     `-no-m4650' turns off this option.

`-m3900'
`-no-m3900'
`-m4100'
`-no-m4100'
     For each option `-mNNNN', generate code for the MIPS RNNNN chip.
     This tells the assembler to accept instructions specific to that
     chip, and to schedule for that chip's hazards.

`-march=CPU'
     Generate code for a particular MIPS cpu.  It is exactly equivalent
     to `-mCPU', except that there are more value of CPU understood.
     Valid CPU value are:

          2000, 3000, 3900, 4000, 4010, 4100, 4111, vr4120, vr4130,
          vr4181, 4300, 4400, 4600, 4650, 5000, rm5200, rm5230, rm5231,
          rm5261, rm5721, vr5400, vr5500, 6000, rm7000, 8000, rm9000,
          10000, 12000, mips32-4k, sb1

`-mtune=CPU'
     Schedule and tune for a particular MIPS cpu.  Valid CPU values are
     identical to `-march=CPU'.

`-mabi=ABI'
     Record which ABI the source code uses.  The recognized arguments
     are: `32', `n32', `o64', `64' and `eabi'.

`-msym32'
`-mno-sym32'
     Equivalent to adding `.set sym32' or `.set nosym32' to the
     beginning of the assembler input.  *Note MIPS symbol sizes::.

`-nocpp'
     This option is ignored.  It is accepted for command-line
     compatibility with other assemblers, which use it to turn off C
     style preprocessing.  With GNU `as', there is no need for
     `-nocpp', because the GNU assembler itself never runs the C
     preprocessor.

`--construct-floats'
`--no-construct-floats'
     The `--no-construct-floats' option disables the construction of
     double width floating point constants by loading the two halves of
     the value into the two single width floating point registers that
     make up the double width register.  This feature is useful if the
     processor support the FR bit in its status  register, and this bit
     is known (by the programmer) to be set.  This bit prevents the
     aliasing of the double width register by the single width
     registers.

     By default `--construct-floats' is selected, allowing construction
     of these floating point constants.

`--trap'
`--no-break'
     `as' automatically macro expands certain division and
     multiplication instructions to check for overflow and division by
     zero.  This option causes `as' to generate code to take a trap
     exception rather than a break exception when an error is detected.
     The trap instructions are only supported at Instruction Set
     Architecture level 2 and higher.

`--break'
`--no-trap'
     Generate code to take a break exception rather than a trap
     exception when an error is detected.  This is the default.

`-mpdr'
`-mno-pdr'
     Control generation of `.pdr' sections.  Off by default on IRIX, on
     elsewhere.

`-mshared'
`-mno-shared'
     When generating code using the Unix calling conventions (selected
     by `-KPIC' or `-mcall_shared'), gas will normally generate code
     which can go into a shared library.  The `-mno-shared' option
     tells gas to generate code which uses the calling convention, but
     can not go into a shared library.  The resulting code is slightly
     more efficient.  This option only affects the handling of the
     `.cpload' and `.cpsetup' pseudo-ops.

8.20.2 MIPS ECOFF object code
-----------------------------

Assembling for a MIPS ECOFF target supports some additional sections
besides the usual `.text', `.data' and `.bss'.  The additional sections
are `.rdata', used for read-only data, `.sdata', used for small data,
and `.sbss', used for small common objects.

   When assembling for ECOFF, the assembler uses the `$gp' (`$28')
register to form the address of a "small object".  Any object in the
`.sdata' or `.sbss' sections is considered "small" in this sense.  For
external objects, or for objects in the `.bss' section, you can use the
`gcc' `-G' option to control the size of objects addressed via `$gp';
the default value is 8, meaning that a reference to any object eight
bytes or smaller uses `$gp'.  Passing `-G 0' to `as' prevents it from
using the `$gp' register on the basis of object size (but the assembler
uses `$gp' for objects in `.sdata' or `sbss' in any case).  The size of
an object in the `.bss' section is set by the `.comm' or `.lcomm'
directive that defines it.  The size of an external object may be set
with the `.extern' directive.  For example, `.extern sym,4' declares
that the object at `sym' is 4 bytes in length, whie leaving `sym'
otherwise undefined.

   Using small ECOFF objects requires linker support, and assumes that
the `$gp' register is correctly initialized (normally done
automatically by the startup code).  MIPS ECOFF assembly code must not
modify the `$gp' register.

8.20.3 Directives for debugging information
-------------------------------------------

MIPS ECOFF `as' supports several directives used for generating
debugging information which are not support by traditional MIPS
assemblers.  These are `.def', `.endef', `.dim', `.file', `.scl',
`.size', `.tag', `.type', `.val', `.stabd', `.stabn', and `.stabs'.
The debugging information generated by the three `.stab' directives can
only be read by GDB, not by traditional MIPS debuggers (this
enhancement is required to fully support C++ debugging).  These
directives are primarily used by compilers, not assembly language
programmers!


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS symbol sizes,  Next: MIPS autoextend,  Prev: MIPS ISA,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

8.20.4 Directives to override the size of symbols
-------------------------------------------------

The n64 ABI allows symbols to have any 64-bit value.  Although this
provides a great deal of flexibility, it means that some macros have
much longer expansions than their 32-bit counterparts.  For example,
the non-PIC expansion of `dla $4,sym' is usually:

     lui     $4,%highest(sym)
     lui     $1,%hi(sym)
     daddiu  $4,$4,%higher(sym)
     daddiu  $1,$1,%lo(sym)
     dsll32  $4,$4,0
     daddu   $4,$4,$1

   whereas the 32-bit expansion is simply:

     lui     $4,%hi(sym)
     daddiu  $4,$4,%lo(sym)

   n64 code is sometimes constructed in such a way that all symbolic
constants are known to have 32-bit values, and in such cases, it's
preferable to use the 32-bit expansion instead of the 64-bit expansion.

   You can use the `.set sym32' directive to tell the assembler that,
from this point on, all expressions of the form `SYMBOL' or `SYMBOL +
OFFSET' have 32-bit values.  For example:

     .set sym32
     dla     $4,sym
     lw      $4,sym+16
     sw      $4,sym+0x8000($4)

   will cause the assembler to treat `sym', `sym+16' and `sym+0x8000'
as 32-bit values.  The handling of non-symbolic addresses is not
affected.

   The directive `.set nosym32' ends a `.set sym32' block and reverts
to the normal behavior.  It is also possible to change the symbol size
using the command-line options `-msym32' and `-mno-sym32'.

   These options and directives are always accepted, but at present,
they have no effect for anything other than n64.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS ISA,  Next: MIPS symbol sizes,  Prev: MIPS Stabs,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

8.20.5 Directives to override the ISA level
-------------------------------------------

GNU `as' supports an additional directive to change the MIPS
Instruction Set Architecture level on the fly: `.set mipsN'.  N should
be a number from 0 to 5, or 32, 32r2, 64 or 64r2.  The values other
than 0 make the assembler accept instructions for the corresponding ISA
level, from that point on in the assembly.  `.set mipsN' affects not
only which instructions are permitted, but also how certain macros are
expanded.  `.set mips0' restores the ISA level to its original level:
either the level you selected with command line options, or the default
for your configuration.  You can use this feature to permit specific
R4000 instructions while assembling in 32 bit mode.  Use this directive
with care!

   The directive `.set mips16' puts the assembler into MIPS 16 mode, in
which it will assemble instructions for the MIPS 16 processor.  Use
`.set nomips16' to return to normal 32 bit mode.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS autoextend,  Next: MIPS insn,  Prev: MIPS symbol sizes,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

8.20.6 Directives for extending MIPS 16 bit instructions
--------------------------------------------------------

By default, MIPS 16 instructions are automatically extended to 32 bits
when necessary.  The directive `.set noautoextend' will turn this off.
When `.set noautoextend' is in effect, any 32 bit instruction must be
explicitly extended with the `.e' modifier (e.g., `li.e $4,1000').  The
directive `.set autoextend' may be used to once again automatically
extend instructions when necessary.

   This directive is only meaningful when in MIPS 16 mode.  Traditional
MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS insn,  Next: MIPS option stack,  Prev: MIPS autoextend,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

8.20.7 Directive to mark data as an instruction
-----------------------------------------------

The `.insn' directive tells `as' that the following data is actually
instructions.  This makes a difference in MIPS 16 mode: when loading
the address of a label which precedes instructions, `as' automatically
adds 1 to the value, so that jumping to the loaded address will do the
right thing.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS option stack,  Next: MIPS ASE instruction generation overrides,  Prev: MIPS insn,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

8.20.8 Directives to save and restore options
---------------------------------------------

The directives `.set push' and `.set pop' may be used to save and
restore the current settings for all the options which are controlled
by `.set'.  The `.set push' directive saves the current settings on a
stack.  The `.set pop' directive pops the stack and restores the
settings.

   These directives can be useful inside an macro which must change an
option such as the ISA level or instruction reordering but does not want
to change the state of the code which invoked the macro.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support these directives.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS ASE instruction generation overrides,  Prev: MIPS option stack,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

8.20.9 Directives to control generation of MIPS ASE instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------

The directive `.set mips3d' makes the assembler accept instructions
from the MIPS-3D Application Specific Extension from that point on in
the assembly.  The `.set nomips3d' directive prevents MIPS-3D
instructions from being accepted.

   The directive `.set mdmx' makes the assembler accept instructions
from the MDMX Application Specific Extension from that point on in the
assembly.  The `.set nomdmx' directive prevents MDMX instructions from
being accepted.

   The directive `.set dsp' makes the assembler accept instructions
from the DSP Application Specific Extension from that point on in the
assembly.  The `.set nodsp' directive prevents DSP instructions from
being accepted.

   The directive `.set mt' makes the assembler accept instructions from
the MT Application Specific Extension from that point on in the
assembly.  The `.set nomt' directive prevents MT instructions from
being accepted.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support these directives.

File: as.info,  Node: MMIX-Opts,  Next: MMIX-Expand,  Up: MMIX-Dependent

8.21.1 Command-line Options
---------------------------

The MMIX version of `as' has some machine-dependent options.

   When `--fixed-special-register-names' is specified, only the register
names specified in *Note MMIX-Regs:: are recognized in the instructions
`PUT' and `GET'.

   You can use the `--globalize-symbols' to make all symbols global.
This option is useful when splitting up a `mmixal' program into several
files.

   The `--gnu-syntax' turns off most syntax compatibility with
`mmixal'.  Its usability is currently doubtful.

   The `--relax' option is not fully supported, but will eventually make
the object file prepared for linker relaxation.

   If you want to avoid inadvertently calling a predefined symbol and
would rather get an error, for example when using `as' with a compiler
or other machine-generated code, specify `--no-predefined-syms'.  This
turns off built-in predefined definitions of all such symbols,
including rounding-mode symbols, segment symbols, `BIT' symbols, and
`TRAP' symbols used in `mmix' "system calls".  It also turns off
predefined special-register names, except when used in `PUT' and `GET'
instructions.

   By default, some instructions are expanded to fit the size of the
operand or an external symbol (*note MMIX-Expand::).  By passing
`--no-expand', no such expansion will be done, instead causing errors
at link time if the operand does not fit.

   The `mmixal' documentation (*note mmixsite::) specifies that global
registers allocated with the `GREG' directive (*note MMIX-greg::) and
initialized to the same non-zero value, will refer to the same global
register.  This isn't strictly enforceable in `as' since the final
addresses aren't known until link-time, but it will do an effort unless
the `--no-merge-gregs' option is specified.  (Register merging isn't
yet implemented in `ld'.)

   `as' will warn every time it expands an instruction to fit an
operand unless the option `-x' is specified.  It is believed that this
behaviour is more useful than just mimicking `mmixal''s behaviour, in
which instructions are only expanded if the `-x' option is specified,
and assembly fails otherwise, when an instruction needs to be expanded.
It needs to be kept in mind that `mmixal' is both an assembler and
linker, while `as' will expand instructions that at link stage can be
contracted.  (Though linker relaxation isn't yet implemented in `ld'.)
The option `-x' also imples `--linker-allocated-gregs'.

   If instruction expansion is enabled, `as' can expand a `PUSHJ'
instruction into a series of instructions.  The shortest expansion is
to not expand it, but just mark the call as redirectable to a stub,
which `ld' creates at link-time, but only if the original `PUSHJ'
instruction is found not to reach the target.  The stub consists of the
necessary instructions to form a jump to the target.  This happens if
`as' can assert that the `PUSHJ' instruction can reach such a stub.
The option `--no-pushj-stubs' disables this shorter expansion, and the
longer series of instructions is then created at assembly-time.  The
option `--no-stubs' is a synonym, intended for compatibility with
future releases, where generation of stubs for other instructions may
be implemented.

   Usually a two-operand-expression (*note GREG-base::) without a
matching `GREG' directive is treated as an error by `as'.  When the
option `--linker-allocated-gregs' is in effect, they are instead passed
through to the linker, which will allocate as many global registers as
is needed.

8.21.2 Instruction expansion
----------------------------

When `as' encounters an instruction with an operand that is either not
known or does not fit the operand size of the instruction, `as' (and
`ld') will expand the instruction into a sequence of instructions
semantically equivalent to the operand fitting the instruction.
Expansion will take place for the following instructions:

`GETA'
     Expands to a sequence of four instructions: `SETL', `INCML',
     `INCMH' and `INCH'.  The operand must be a multiple of four.

Conditional branches
     A branch instruction is turned into a branch with the complemented
     condition and prediction bit over five instructions; four
     instructions setting `$255' to the operand value, which like with
     `GETA' must be a multiple of four, and a final `GO $255,$255,0'.

`PUSHJ'
     Similar to expansion for conditional branches; four instructions
     set `$255' to the operand value, followed by a `PUSHGO
     $255,$255,0'.

`JMP'
     Similar to conditional branches and `PUSHJ'.  The final instruction
     is `GO $255,$255,0'.

   The linker `ld' is expected to shrink these expansions for code
assembled with `--relax' (though not currently implemented).

8.21.3 Syntax
-------------

The assembly syntax is supposed to be upward compatible with that
described in Sections 1.3 and 1.4 of `The Art of Computer Programming,
Volume 1'.  Draft versions of those chapters as well as other MMIX
information is located at
`http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix-news.html'.  Most code
examples from the mmixal package located there should work unmodified
when assembled and linked as single files, with a few noteworthy
exceptions (*note MMIX-mmixal::).

   Before an instruction is emitted, the current location is aligned to
the next four-byte boundary.  If a label is defined at the beginning of
the line, its value will be the aligned value.

   In addition to the traditional hex-prefix `0x', a hexadecimal number
can also be specified by the prefix character `#'.

   After all operands to an MMIX instruction or directive have been
specified, the rest of the line is ignored, treated as a comment.

8.21.3.1 Special Characters
...........................

The characters `*' and `#' are line comment characters; each start a
comment at the beginning of a line, but only at the beginning of a
line.  A `#' prefixes a hexadecimal number if found elsewhere on a line.

   Two other characters, `%' and `!', each start a comment anywhere on
the line.  Thus you can't use the `modulus' and `not' operators in
expressions normally associated with these two characters.

   A `;' is a line separator, treated as a new-line, so separate
instructions can be specified on a single line.


File: as.info,  Node: MMIX-Symbols,  Next: MMIX-Regs,  Prev: MMIX-Chars,  Up: MMIX-Syntax

8.21.3.2 Symbols
................

The character `:' is permitted in identifiers.  There are two
exceptions to it being treated as any other symbol character: if a
symbol begins with `:', it means that the symbol is in the global
namespace and that the current prefix should not be prepended to that
symbol (*note MMIX-prefix::).  The `:' is then not considered part of
the symbol.  For a symbol in the label position (first on a line), a `:'
at the end of a symbol is silently stripped off.  A label is permitted,
but not required, to be followed by a `:', as with many other assembly
formats.

   The character `@@' in an expression, is a synonym for `.', the
current location.

   In addition to the common forward and backward local symbol formats
(*note Symbol Names::), they can be specified with upper-case `B' and
`F', as in `8B' and `9F'.  A local label defined for the current
position is written with a `H' appended to the number:
     3H LDB $0,$1,2
   This and traditional local-label formats cannot be mixed: a label
must be defined and referred to using the same format.

   There's a minor caveat: just as for the ordinary local symbols, the
local symbols are translated into ordinary symbols using control
characters are to hide the ordinal number of the symbol.
Unfortunately, these symbols are not translated back in error messages.
Thus you may see confusing error messages when local symbols are used.
Control characters `\003' (control-C) and `\004' (control-D) are used
for the MMIX-specific local-symbol syntax.

   The symbol `Main' is handled specially; it is always global.

   By defining the symbols `__.MMIX.start..text' and
`__.MMIX.start..data', the address of respectively the `.text' and
`.data' segments of the final program can be defined, though when
linking more than one object file, the code or data in the object file
containing the symbol is not guaranteed to be start at that position;
just the final executable.  *Note MMIX-loc::.

8.21.3.3 Register names
.......................

Local and global registers are specified as `$0' to `$255'.  The
recognized special register names are `rJ', `rA', `rB', `rC', `rD',
`rE', `rF', `rG', `rH', `rI', `rK', `rL', `rM', `rN', `rO', `rP', `rQ',
`rR', `rS', `rT', `rU', `rV', `rW', `rX', `rY', `rZ', `rBB', `rTT',
`rWW', `rXX', `rYY' and `rZZ'.  A leading `:' is optional for special
register names.

   Local and global symbols can be equated to register names and used in
place of ordinary registers.

   Similarly for special registers, local and global symbols can be
used.  Also, symbols equated from numbers and constant expressions are
allowed in place of a special register, except when either of the
options `--no-predefined-syms' and `--fixed-special-register-names' are
specified.  Then only the special register names above are allowed for
the instructions having a special register operand; `GET' and `PUT'.

8.21.3.4 Assembler Directives
.............................

`LOC'
     The `LOC' directive sets the current location to the value of the
     operand field, which may include changing sections.  If the
     operand is a constant, the section is set to either `.data' if the
     value is `0x2000000000000000' or larger, else it is set to `.text'.
     Within a section, the current location may only be changed to
     monotonically higher addresses.  A LOC expression must be a
     previously defined symbol or a "pure" constant.

     An example, which sets the label PREV to the current location, and
     updates the current location to eight bytes forward:
          prev LOC @@+8

     When a LOC has a constant as its operand, a symbol
     `__.MMIX.start..text' or `__.MMIX.start..data' is defined
     depending on the address as mentioned above.  Each such symbol is
     interpreted as special by the linker, locating the section at that
     address.  Note that if multiple files are linked, the first object
     file with that section will be mapped to that address (not
     necessarily the file with the LOC definition).

`LOCAL'
     Example:
           LOCAL external_symbol
           LOCAL 42
           .local asymbol

     This directive-operation generates a link-time assertion that the
     operand does not correspond to a global register.  The operand is
     an expression that at link-time resolves to a register symbol or a
     number.  A number is treated as the register having that number.
     There is one restriction on the use of this directive: the
     pseudo-directive must be placed in a section with contents, code
     or data.

`IS'
     The `IS' directive:
          asymbol IS an_expression
     sets the symbol `asymbol' to `an_expression'.  A symbol may not be
     set more than once using this directive.  Local labels may be set
     using this directive, for example:
          5H IS @@+4

`GREG'
     This directive reserves a global register, gives it an initial
     value and optionally gives it a symbolic name.  Some examples:

          areg GREG
          breg GREG data_value
               GREG data_buffer
               .greg creg, another_data_value

     The symbolic register name can be used in place of a (non-special)
     register.  If a value isn't provided, it defaults to zero.  Unless
     the option `--no-merge-gregs' is specified, non-zero registers
     allocated with this directive may be eliminated by `as'; another
     register with the same value used in its place.  Any of the
     instructions `CSWAP', `GO', `LDA', `LDBU', `LDB', `LDHT', `LDOU',
     `LDO', `LDSF', `LDTU', `LDT', `LDUNC', `LDVTS', `LDWU', `LDW',
     `PREGO', `PRELD', `PREST', `PUSHGO', `STBU', `STB', `STCO', `STHT',
     `STOU', `STSF', `STTU', `STT', `STUNC', `SYNCD', `SYNCID', can
     have a value nearby an initial value in place of its second and
     third operands.  Here, "nearby" is defined as within the range
     0...255 from the initial value of such an allocated register.

          buffer1 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
          buffer2 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
           ...
           GREG buffer1
           LDOU $42,buffer2
     In the example above, the `Y' field of the `LDOUI' instruction
     (LDOU with a constant Z) will be replaced with the global register
     allocated for `buffer1', and the `Z' field will have the value 5,
     the offset from `buffer1' to `buffer2'.  The result is equivalent
     to this code:
          buffer1 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
          buffer2 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
           ...
          tmpreg GREG buffer1
           LDOU $42,tmpreg,(buffer2-buffer1)

     Global registers allocated with this directive are allocated in
     order higher-to-lower within a file.  Other than that, the exact
     order of register allocation and elimination is undefined.  For
     example, the order is undefined when more than one file with such
     directives are linked together.  With the options `-x' and
     `--linker-allocated-gregs', `GREG' directives for two-operand
     cases like the one mentioned above can be omitted.  Sufficient
     global registers will then be allocated by the linker.

`BYTE'
     The `BYTE' directive takes a series of operands separated by a
     comma.  If an operand is a string (*note Strings::), each
     character of that string is emitted as a byte.  Other operands
     must be constant expressions without forward references, in the
     range 0...255.  If you need operands having expressions with
     forward references, use `.byte' (*note Byte::).  An operand can be
     omitted, defaulting to a zero value.

`WYDE'
`TETRA'
`OCTA'
     The directives `WYDE', `TETRA' and `OCTA' emit constants of two,
     four and eight bytes size respectively.  Before anything else
     happens for the directive, the current location is aligned to the
     respective constant-size boundary.  If a label is defined at the
     beginning of the line, its value will be that after the alignment.
     A single operand can be omitted, defaulting to a zero value
     emitted for the directive.  Operands can be expressed as strings
     (*note Strings::), in which case each character in the string is
     emitted as a separate constant of the size indicated by the
     directive.

`PREFIX'
     The `PREFIX' directive sets a symbol name prefix to be prepended to
     all symbols (except local symbols, *note MMIX-Symbols::), that are
     not prefixed with `:', until the next `PREFIX' directive.  Such
     prefixes accumulate.  For example,
           PREFIX a
           PREFIX b
          c IS 0
     defines a symbol `abc' with the value 0.

`BSPEC'
`ESPEC'
     A pair of `BSPEC' and `ESPEC' directives delimit a section of
     special contents (without specified semantics).  Example:
           BSPEC 42
           TETRA 1,2,3
           ESPEC
     The single operand to `BSPEC' must be number in the range 0...255.
     The `BSPEC' number 80 is used by the GNU binutils implementation.

8.21.4 Differences to `mmixal'
------------------------------

The binutils `as' and `ld' combination has a few differences in
function compared to `mmixal' (*note mmixsite::).

   The replacement of a symbol with a GREG-allocated register (*note
GREG-base::) is not handled the exactly same way in `as' as in
`mmixal'.  This is apparent in the `mmixal' example file `inout.mms',
where different registers with different offsets, eventually yielding
the same address, are used in the first instruction.  This type of
difference should however not affect the function of any program unless
it has specific assumptions about the allocated register number.

   Line numbers (in the `mmo' object format) are currently not
supported.

   Expression operator precedence is not that of mmixal: operator
precedence is that of the C programming language.  It's recommended to
use parentheses to explicitly specify wanted operator precedence
whenever more than one type of operators are used.

   The serialize unary operator `&', the fractional division operator
`//', the logical not operator `!' and the modulus operator `%' are not
available.

   Symbols are not global by default, unless the option
`--globalize-symbols' is passed.  Use the `.global' directive to
globalize symbols (*note Global::).

   Operand syntax is a bit stricter with `as' than `mmixal'.  For
example, you can't say `addu 1,2,3', instead you must write `addu
$1,$2,3'.

   You can't LOC to a lower address than those already visited (i.e.
"backwards").

   A LOC directive must come before any emitted code.

   Predefined symbols are visible as file-local symbols after use.  (In
the ELF file, that is--the linked mmo file has no notion of a file-local
symbol.)

   Some mapping of constant expressions to sections in LOC expressions
is attempted, but that functionality is easily confused and should be
avoided unless compatibility with `mmixal' is required.  A LOC
expression to `0x2000000000000000' or higher, maps to the `.data'
section and lower addresses map to the `.text' section (*note
MMIX-loc::).

   The code and data areas are each contiguous.  Sparse programs with
far-away LOC directives will take up the same amount of space as a
contiguous program with zeros filled in the gaps between the LOC
directives.  If you need sparse programs, you might try and get the
wanted effect with a linker script and splitting up the code parts into
sections (*note Section::).  Assembly code for this, to be compatible
with `mmixal', would look something like:
      .if 0
      LOC away_expression
      .else
      .section away,"ax"
      .fi
   `as' will not execute the LOC directive and `mmixal' ignores the
lines with `.'.  This construct can be used generally to help
compatibility.

   Symbols can't be defined twice-not even to the same value.

   Instruction mnemonics are recognized case-insensitive, though the
`IS' and `GREG' pseudo-operations must be specified in upper-case
characters.

   There's no unicode support.

   The following is a list of programs in `mmix.tar.gz', available at
`http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix-news.html', last
checked with the version dated 2001-08-25 (md5sum
c393470cfc86fac040487d22d2bf0172) that assemble with `mmixal' but do
not assemble with `as':

`silly.mms'
     LOC to a previous address.

`sim.mms'
     Redefines symbol `Done'.

`test.mms'
     Uses the serial operator `&'.

8.22.2.1 Macros
...............

The macro syntax used on the MSP 430 is like that described in the MSP
430 Family Assembler Specification.  Normal `as' macros should still
work.

   Additional built-in macros are:

`llo(exp)'
     Extracts least significant word from 32-bit expression 'exp'.

`lhi(exp)'
     Extracts most significant word from 32-bit expression 'exp'.

`hlo(exp)'
     Extracts 3rd word from 64-bit expression 'exp'.

`hhi(exp)'
     Extracts 4rd word from 64-bit expression 'exp'.


   They normally being used as an immediate source operand.
         mov	#llo(1), r10	;	== mov	#1, r10
         mov	#lhi(1), r10	;	== mov	#0, r10

`;' is the line comment character.

   The character `$' in jump instructions indicates current location and

8.22.2.3 Register Names
.......................

General-purpose registers are represented by predefined symbols of the
form `rN' (for global registers), where N represents a number between
`0' and `15'.  The leading letters may be in either upper or lower
case; for example, `r13' and `R7' are both valid register names.

   Register names `PC', `SP' and `SR' cannot be used as register names
and will be treated as variables. Use `r0', `r1', and `r2' instead.


File: as.info,  Node: MSP430-Ext,  Prev: MSP430-Regs,  Up: MSP430 Syntax

8.22.2.4 Assembler Extensions
.............................

`@@rN'
     As destination operand being treated as `0(rn)'

`0(rN)'
     As source operand being treated as `@@rn'

`jCOND +N'
     Skips next N bytes followed by jump instruction and equivalent to
     `jCOND $+N+2'


   Also, there are some instructions, which cannot be found in other
assemblers.  These are branch instructions, which has different opcodes
upon jump distance.  They all got PC relative addressing mode.

`beq label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jeq label' in case if jump
     distance within allowed range for cpu's jump instruction. If not,
     this unrolls into a sequence of
            jne $+6
            br  label

`bne label'
     A polymorph instruction which is `jne label' or `jeq +4; br label'

File: as.info,  Node: MSP430 Profiling Capability,  Prev: MSP430 Opcodes,  Up: MSP430-Dependent

8.22.6 Profiling Capability
---------------------------

It is a performance hit to use gcc's profiling approach for this tiny
target.  Even more - jtag hardware facility does not perform any
profiling functions.  However we've got gdb's built-in simulator where
we can do anything.

   We define new section `.profiler' which holds all profiling
information.  We define new pseudo operation `.profiler' which will
instruct assembler to add new profile entry to the object file. Profile
should take place at the present address.

   Pseudo operation format:

   `.profiler flags,function_to_profile [, cycle_corrector, extra]'

   where:

          `flags' is a combination of the following characters:

    `s'
          function entry

    `x'
          function exit

    `i'
          function is in init section

    `f'
          function is in fini section

    `l'
          library call

    `c'
          libc standard call

    `d'
          stack value demand

    `I'
          interrupt service routine

    `P'
          prologue start

    `p'
          prologue end

    `E'
          epilogue start

    `e'
          epilogue end

    `j'
          long jump / sjlj unwind

    `a'
          an arbitrary code fragment

    `t'
          extra parameter saved (a constant value like frame size)

`function_to_profile'
     a function address

`cycle_corrector'
     a value which should be added to the cycle counter, zero if
     omitted.

`extra'
     any extra parameter, zero if omitted.


   For example:
     .global fxx
     .type fxx,@@function
     fxx:
     .LFrameOffset_fxx=0x08
     .profiler "scdP", fxx     ; function entry.
     			  ; we also demand stack value to be saved
       push r11
       push r10
       push r9
       push r8
     .profiler "cdpt",fxx,0, .LFrameOffset_fxx  ; check stack value at this point
     					  ; (this is a prologue end)
     					  ; note, that spare var filled with
     					  ; the farme size
       mov r15,r8
     ...
     .profiler cdE,fxx         ; check stack
       pop r8
       pop r9
       pop r10
       pop r11
     .profiler xcde,fxx,3      ; exit adds 3 to the cycle counter

8.23.3 PDP-11 Assembly Language Syntax
--------------------------------------

`as' supports both DEC syntax and BSD syntax.  The only difference is
that in DEC syntax, a `#' character is used to denote an immediate
constants, while in BSD syntax the character for this purpose is `$'.

   eneral-purpose registers are named `r0' through `r7'.  Mnemonic
alternatives for `r6' and `r7' are `sp' and `pc', respectively.

   Floating-point registers are named `ac0' through `ac3', or
alternatively `fr0' through `fr3'.

   Comments are started with a `#' or a `/' character, and extend to
the end of the line.  (FIXME: clash with immediates?)

8.26.2.1 Special Characters
...........................

`!' is the line comment character.

   You can use `;' instead of a newline to separate statements.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.


File: as.info,  Node: SH-Regs,  Next: SH-Addressing,  Prev: SH-Chars,  Up: SH Syntax

8.26.2.2 Register Names
.......................

You can use the predefined symbols `r0', `r1', `r2', `r3', `r4', `r5',
`r6', `r7', `r8', `r9', `r10', `r11', `r12', `r13', `r14', and `r15' to
refer to the SH registers.

   The SH also has these control registers:

`pr'
     procedure register (holds return address)

`pc'
     program counter

`mach'
`macl'
     high and low multiply accumulator registers

`sr'
     status register

`gbr'
     global base register

`vbr'
     vector base register (for interrupt vectors)


File: as.info,  Node: SH-Addressing,  Prev: SH-Regs,  Up: SH Syntax

8.26.2.3 Addressing Modes
.........................

`as' understands the following addressing modes for the SH.  `RN' in
the following refers to any of the numbered registers, but _not_ the
control registers.

`RN'
     Register direct

`@@RN'
     Register indirect

`@@-RN'
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

`@@RN+'
     Register indirect with post-increment

`@@(DISP, RN)'
     Register indirect with displacement

`@@(R0, RN)'
     Register indexed

`@@(DISP, GBR)'
     `GBR' offset

`@@(R0, GBR)'
     GBR indexed

`ADDR'
`@@(DISP, PC)'
     PC relative address (for branch or for addressing memory).  The
     `as' implementation allows you to use the simpler form ADDR
     anywhere a PC relative address is called for; the alternate form
     is supported for compatibility with other assemblers.

`#IMM'
     Immediate data


File: as.info,  Node: SH Floating Point,  Next: SH Directives,  Prev: SH Syntax,  Up: SH-Dependent

8.26.3 Floating Point
---------------------

SH2E, SH3E and SH4 groups have on-chip floating-point unit (FPU). Other
SH groups can use `.float' directive to generate IEEE floating-point
numbers.

   SH2E and SH3E support single-precision floating point calculations as
well as entirely PCAPI compatible emulation of double-precision
floating point calculations. SH2E and SH3E instructions are a subset of
the floating point calculations conforming to the IEEE754 standard.

   In addition to single-precision and double-precision floating-point
operation capability, the on-chip FPU of SH4 has a 128-bit graphic
engine that enables 32-bit floating-point data to be processed 128 bits
at a time. It also supports 4 * 4 array operations and inner product
operations. Also, a superscalar architecture is employed that enables
simultaneous execution of two instructions (including FPU
instructions), providing performance of up to twice that of
conventional architectures at the same frequency.


File: as.info,  Node: SH Directives,  Next: SH Opcodes,  Prev: SH Floating Point,  Up: SH-Dependent

8.26.4 SH Machine Directives
----------------------------

`uaword'
`ualong'
     `as' will issue a warning when a misaligned `.word' or `.long'
     directive is used.  You may use `.uaword' or `.ualong' to indicate
     that the value is intentionally misaligned.


File: as.info,  Node: SH Opcodes,  Prev: SH Directives,  Up: SH-Dependent

8.26.5 Opcodes
--------------

For detailed information on the SH machine instruction set, see
`SH-Microcomputer User's Manual' (Renesas) or `SH-4 32-bit CPU Core
Architecture' (SuperH) and `SuperH (SH) 64-Bit RISC Series' (SuperH).

   `as' implements all the standard SH opcodes.  No additional
pseudo-instructions are needed on this family.  Note, however, that
because `as' supports a simpler form of PC-relative addressing, you may
simply write (for example)

     mov.l  bar,r0

where other assemblers might require an explicit displacement to `bar'
from the program counter:

     mov.l  @@(DISP, PC)

   Here is a summary of SH opcodes:

     Enable sh1, sh2, sh2e, sh3, sh3e, sh4, sh4a, and sh-dsp insn sets.

`-isa=shmedia | -isa=shcompact'
     Specify the default instruction set.  `SHmedia' specifies the
     32-bit opcodes, and `SHcompact' specifies the 16-bit opcodes
     compatible with previous SH families.  The default depends on the
     ABI selected; the default for the 64-bit ABI is SHmedia, and the
     default for the 32-bit ABI is SHcompact.  If neither the ABI nor
     the ISA is specified, the default is 32-bit SHcompact.

     Note that the `.mode' pseudo-op is not permitted if the ISA is not
     specified on the command line.

`-abi=32 | -abi=64'
     Specify the default ABI.  If the ISA is specified and the ABI is
     not, the default ABI depends on the ISA, with SHmedia defaulting
     to 64-bit and SHcompact defaulting to 32-bit.

     Note that the `.abi' pseudo-op is not permitted if the ABI is not
     specified on the command line.  When the ABI is specified on the
     command line, any `.abi' pseudo-ops in the source must match it.

`-shcompact-const-crange'
     Emit code-range descriptors for constants in SHcompact code
     sections.

`-no-mix'
     Disallow SHmedia code in the same section as constants and
     SHcompact code.

`-no-expand'
     Do not expand MOVI, PT, PTA or PTB instructions.

`-expand-pt32'
     With -abi=64, expand PT, PTA and PTB instructions to 32 bits only.

8.27.2.1 Special Characters
...........................

`!' is the line comment character.

   You can use `;' instead of a newline to separate statements.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.

8.27.2.2 Register Names
.......................

You can use the predefined symbols `r0' through `r63' to refer to the
SH64 general registers, `cr0' through `cr63' for control registers,
`tr0' through `tr7' for target address registers, `fr0' through `fr63'
for single-precision floating point registers, `dr0' through `dr62'
(even numbered registers only) for double-precision floating point
registers, `fv0' through `fv60' (multiples of four only) for
single-precision floating point vectors, `fp0' through `fp62' (even
numbered registers only) for single-precision floating point pairs,
`mtrx0' through `mtrx48' (multiples of 16 only) for 4x4 matrices of
single-precision floating point registers, `pc' for the program
counter, and `fpscr' for the floating point status and control register.

   You can also refer to the control registers by the mnemonics `sr',
`ssr', `pssr', `intevt', `expevt', `pexpevt', `tra', `spc', `pspc',
`resvec', `vbr', `tea', `dcr', `kcr0', `kcr1', `ctc', and `usr'.


File: as.info,  Node: SH64-Addressing,  Prev: SH64-Regs,  Up: SH64 Syntax

8.27.2.3 Addressing Modes
.........................

SH64 operands consist of either a register or immediate value.  The
immediate value can be a constant or label reference (or portion of a
label reference), as in this example:

     	movi	4,r2
     	pt	function, tr4
     	movi	(function >> 16) & 65535,r0
     	shori	function & 65535, r0
     	ld.l	r0,4,r0

   Instruction label references can reference labels in either SHmedia
or SHcompact.  To differentiate between the two, labels in SHmedia
sections will always have the least significant bit set (i.e. they will
be odd), which SHcompact labels will have the least significant bit
reset (i.e. they will be even).  If you need to reference the actual
address of a label, you can use the `datalabel' modifier, as in this
example:

     	.long	function
     	.long	datalabel function

   In that example, the first longword may or may not have the least
significant bit set depending on whether the label is an SHmedia label
or an SHcompact label.  The second longword will be the actual address
of the label, regardless of what type of label it is.

8.27.3 SH64 Machine Directives
------------------------------

In addition to the SH directives, the SH64 provides the following
directives:

`.mode [shmedia|shcompact]'
`.isa [shmedia|shcompact]'
     Specify the ISA for the following instructions (the two directives
     are equivalent).  Note that programs such as `objdump' rely on
     symbolic labels to determine when such mode switches occur (by
     checking the least significant bit of the label's address), so
     such mode/isa changes should always be followed by a label (in
     practice, this is true anyway).  Note that you cannot use these
     directives if you didn't specify an ISA on the command line.

`.abi [32|64]'
     Specify the ABI for the following instructions.  Note that you
     cannot use this directive unless you specified an ABI on the
     command line, and the ABIs specified must match.

`.uaquad'
     Like .uaword and .ualong, this allows you to specify an
     intentionally unaligned quadword (64 bit word).

8.27.4 Opcodes
--------------

For detailed information on the SH64 machine instruction set, see
`SuperH 64 bit RISC Series Architecture Manual' (SuperH, Inc.).

   `as' implements all the standard SH64 opcodes.  In addition, the
following pseudo-opcodes may be expanded into one or more alternate
opcodes:

`movi'
     If the value doesn't fit into a standard `movi' opcode, `as' will
     replace the `movi' with a sequence of `movi' and `shori' opcodes.

`pt'
     This expands to a sequence of `movi' and `shori' opcode, followed
     by a `ptrel' opcode, or to a `pta' or `ptb' opcode, depending on
     the label referenced.

8.28.1 Options
--------------

The SPARC chip family includes several successive levels, using the same
core instruction set, but including a few additional instructions at
each level.  There are exceptions to this however.  For details on what
instructions each variant supports, please see the chip's architecture
reference manual.

   By default, `as' assumes the core instruction set (SPARC v6), but
"bumps" the architecture level as needed: it switches to successively
higher architectures as it encounters instructions that only exist in
the higher levels.

   If not configured for SPARC v9 (`sparc64-*-*') GAS will not bump
passed sparclite by default, an option must be passed to enable the v9
instructions.

   GAS treats sparclite as being compatible with v8, unless an
architecture is explicitly requested.  SPARC v9 is always incompatible
with sparclite.

`-Av6 | -Av7 | -Av8 | -Asparclet | -Asparclite'
`-Av8plus | -Av8plusa | -Av9 | -Av9a'
     Use one of the `-A' options to select one of the SPARC
     architectures explicitly.  If you select an architecture
     explicitly, `as' reports a fatal error if it encounters an
     instruction or feature requiring an incompatible or higher level.

     `-Av8plus' and `-Av8plusa' select a 32 bit environment.

     `-Av9' and `-Av9a' select a 64 bit environment and are not
     available unless GAS is explicitly configured with 64 bit
     environment support.

     `-Av8plusa' and `-Av9a' enable the SPARC V9 instruction set with
     UltraSPARC extensions.

`-xarch=v8plus | -xarch=v8plusa'
     For compatibility with the Solaris v9 assembler.  These options are
     equivalent to -Av8plus and -Av8plusa, respectively.

`-bump'
     Warn whenever it is necessary to switch to another level.  If an
     architecture level is explicitly requested, GAS will not issue
     warnings until that level is reached, and will then bump the level
     as required (except between incompatible levels).

`-32 | -64'
     Select the word size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.  These options
     are only available with the ELF object file format, and require
     that the necessary BFD support has been included.

8.28.2 Enforcing aligned data
-----------------------------

SPARC GAS normally permits data to be misaligned.  For example, it
permits the `.long' pseudo-op to be used on a byte boundary.  However,
the native SunOS and Solaris assemblers issue an error when they see
misaligned data.

   You can use the `--enforce-aligned-data' option to make SPARC GAS
also issue an error about misaligned data, just as the SunOS and Solaris
assemblers do.

   The `--enforce-aligned-data' option is not the default because gcc
issues misaligned data pseudo-ops when it initializes certain packed
data structures (structures defined using the `packed' attribute).  You
may have to assemble with GAS in order to initialize packed data
structures in your own code.

8.28.3 Floating Point
---------------------

The Sparc uses IEEE floating-point numbers.


File: as.info,  Node: Sparc-Directives,  Prev: Sparc-Float,  Up: Sparc-Dependent

8.28.4 Sparc Machine Directives
-------------------------------

The Sparc version of `as' supports the following additional machine
directives:

`.align'
     This must be followed by the desired alignment in bytes.

`.common'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.comm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.half'
     This is functionally identical to `.short'.

`.nword'
     On the Sparc, the `.nword' directive produces native word sized
     value, ie. if assembling with -32 it is equivalent to `.word', if
     assembling with -64 it is equivalent to `.xword'.

`.proc'
     This directive is ignored.  Any text following it on the same line
     is also ignored.

`.register'
     This directive declares use of a global application or system
     register.  It must be followed by a register name %g2, %g3, %g6 or
     %g7, comma and the symbol name for that register.  If symbol name
     is `#scratch', it is a scratch register, if it is `#ignore', it
     just suppresses any errors about using undeclared global register,
     but does not emit any information about it into the object file.
     This can be useful e.g. if you save the register before use and
     restore it after.

`.reserve'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.lcomm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.seg'
     This must be followed by `"text"', `"data"', or `"data1"'.  It
     behaves like `.text', `.data', or `.data 1'.

`.skip'
     This is functionally identical to the `.space' directive.

`.word'
     On the Sparc, the `.word' directive produces 32 bit values,
     instead of the 16 bit values it produces on many other machines.

`.xword'
     On the Sparc V9 processor, the `.xword' directive produces 64 bit
     values.

8.29.1 Options
--------------

The TMS320C54x version of `as' has a few machine-dependent options.

   You can use the `-mfar-mode' option to enable extended addressing
mode.  All addresses will be assumed to be > 16 bits, and the
appropriate relocation types will be used.  This option is equivalent
to using the `.far_mode' directive in the assembly code.  If you do not
use the `-mfar-mode' option, all references will be assumed to be 16
bits.  This option may be abbreviated to `-mf'.

   You can use the `-mcpu' option to specify a particular CPU.  This
option is equivalent to using the `.version' directive in the assembly
code.  For recognized CPU codes, see *Note `.version':
TIC54X-Directives.  The default CPU version is `542'.

   You can use the `-merrors-to-file' option to redirect error output
to a file (this provided for those deficient environments which don't
provide adequate output redirection).  This option may be abbreviated to
`-me'.

     Octal                   `10Q, 224q'

8.29.5 String Substitution
--------------------------

A subset of allowable symbols (which we'll call subsyms) may be assigned
arbitrary string values.  This is roughly equivalent to C preprocessor
#define macros.  When `as' encounters one of these symbols, the symbol
is replaced in the input stream by its string value.  Subsym names
*must* begin with a letter.

   Subsyms may be defined using the `.asg' and `.eval' directives
(*Note `.asg': TIC54X-Directives, *Note `.eval': TIC54X-Directives.

   Expansion is recursive until a previously encountered symbol is
seen, at which point substitution stops.

   In this example, x is replaced with SYM2; SYM2 is replaced with
SYM1, and SYM1 is replaced with x.  At this point, x has already been
encountered and the substitution stops.

      .asg   "x",SYM1
      .asg   "SYM1",SYM2
      .asg   "SYM2",x
      add    x,a             ; final code assembled is "add  x, a"

   Macro parameters are converted to subsyms; a side effect of this is
the normal `as' '\ARG' dereferencing syntax is unnecessary.  Subsyms
defined within a macro will have global scope, unless the `.var'
directive is used to identify the subsym as a local macro variable
*note `.var': TIC54X-Directives.

   Substitution may be forced in situations where replacement might be
ambiguous by placing colons on either side of the subsym.  The following
code:

      .eval  "10",x
     LAB:X:  add     #x, a

   When assembled becomes:

     LAB10  add     #10, a

   Smaller parts of the string assigned to a subsym may be accessed with
the following syntax:

``:SYMBOL(CHAR_INDEX):''
     Evaluates to a single-character string, the character at
     CHAR_INDEX.

``:SYMBOL(START,LENGTH):''
     Evaluates to a substring of SYMBOL beginning at START with length
     LENGTH.

8.29.6 Local Labels
-------------------

Local labels may be defined in two ways:

   * $N, where N is a decimal number between 0 and 9

   * LABEL?, where LABEL is any legal symbol name.

   Local labels thus defined may be redefined or automatically
generated.  The scope of a local label is based on when it may be
undefined or reset.  This happens when one of the following situations
is encountered:

   * .newblock directive *note `.newblock': TIC54X-Directives.

   * The current section is changed (.sect, .text, or .data)

   * Entering or leaving an included file

   * The macro scope where the label was defined is exited

8.29.9 Directives
-----------------

`.align [SIZE]'
`.even'
     Align the section program counter on the next boundary, based on
     SIZE.  SIZE may be any power of 2.  `.even' is equivalent to
     `.align' with a SIZE of 2.
    `1'
          Align SPC to word boundary

    `2'
          Align SPC to longword boundary (same as .even)

    `128'
          Align SPC to page boundary

`.asg STRING, NAME'
     Assign NAME the string STRING.  String replacement is performed on
     STRING before assignment.

`.eval STRING, NAME'
     Evaluate the contents of string STRING and assign the result as a
     string to the subsym NAME.  String replacement is performed on
     STRING before assignment.

`.bss SYMBOL, SIZE [, [BLOCKING_FLAG] [,ALIGNMENT_FLAG]]'
     Reserve space for SYMBOL in the .bss section.  SIZE is in words.
     If present, BLOCKING_FLAG indicates the allocated space should be
     aligned on a page boundary if it would otherwise cross a page
     boundary.  If present, ALIGNMENT_FLAG causes the assembler to
     allocate SIZE on a long word boundary.

`.byte VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ubyte VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.char VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uchar VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more bytes into consecutive words of the current
     section.  The upper 8 bits of each word is zero-filled.  If a
     label is used, it points to the word allocated for the first byte
     encountered.

`.clink ["SECTION_NAME"]'
     Set STYP_CLINK flag for this section, which indicates to the
     linker that if no symbols from this section are referenced, the
     section should not be included in the link.  If SECTION_NAME is
     omitted, the current section is used.

`.c_mode'
     TBD.

`.copy "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
`.include "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
     Read source statements from FILENAME.  The normal include search
     path is used.  Normally .copy will cause statements from the
     included file to be printed in the assembly listing and .include
     will not, but this distinction is not currently implemented.

`.data'
     Begin assembling code into the .data section.

`.double VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ldouble VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.float VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.xfloat VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place an IEEE single-precision floating-point representation of
     one or more floating-point values into the current section.  All
     but `.xfloat' align the result on a longword boundary.  Values are
     stored most-significant word first.

`.drlist'
`.drnolist'
     Control printing of directives to the listing file.  Ignored.

`.emsg STRING'
`.mmsg STRING'
`.wmsg STRING'
     Emit a user-defined error, message, or warning, respectively.

`.far_mode'
     Use extended addressing when assembling statements.  This should
     appear only once per file, and is equivalent to the -mfar-mode
     option *note `-mfar-mode': TIC54X-Opts.

`.fclist'
`.fcnolist'
     Control printing of false conditional blocks to the listing file.

`.field VALUE [,SIZE]'
     Initialize a bitfield of SIZE bits in the current section.  If
     VALUE is relocatable, then SIZE must be 16.  SIZE defaults to 16
     bits.  If VALUE does not fit into SIZE bits, the value will be
     truncated.  Successive `.field' directives will pack starting at
     the current word, filling the most significant bits first, and
     aligning to the start of the next word if the field size does not
     fit into the space remaining in the current word.  A `.align'
     directive with an operand of 1 will force the next `.field'
     directive to begin packing into a new word.  If a label is used, it
     points to the word that contains the specified field.

`.global SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
`.def SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
`.ref SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
     `.def' nominally identifies a symbol defined in the current file
     and availalbe to other files.  `.ref' identifies a symbol used in
     the current file but defined elsewhere.  Both map to the standard
     `.global' directive.

`.half VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uhalf VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.short VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ushort VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.int VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uint VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.word VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uword VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more values into consecutive words of the current
     section.  If a label is used, it points to the word allocated for
     the first value encountered.

`.label SYMBOL'
     Define a special SYMBOL to refer to the load time address of the
     current section program counter.

`.length'
`.width'
     Set the page length and width of the output listing file.  Ignored.

`.list'
`.nolist'
     Control whether the source listing is printed.  Ignored.

`.long VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ulong VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.xlong VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more 32-bit values into consecutive words in the
     current section.  The most significant word is stored first.
     `.long' and `.ulong' align the result on a longword boundary;
     `xlong' does not.

`.loop [COUNT]'
`.break [CONDITION]'
`.endloop'
     Repeatedly assemble a block of code.  `.loop' begins the block, and
     `.endloop' marks its termination.  COUNT defaults to 1024, and
     indicates the number of times the block should be repeated.
     `.break' terminates the loop so that assembly begins after the
     `.endloop' directive.  The optional CONDITION will cause the loop
     to terminate only if it evaluates to zero.

`MACRO_NAME .macro [PARAM1][,...PARAM_N]'
`[.mexit]'
`.endm'
     See the section on macros for more explanation (*Note
     TIC54X-Macros::.

`.mlib "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
     Load the macro library FILENAME.  FILENAME must be an archived
     library (BFD ar-compatible) of text files, expected to contain
     only macro definitions.   The standard include search path is used.

`.mlist'

`.mnolist'
     Control whether to include macro and loop block expansions in the
     listing output.  Ignored.

`.mmregs'
     Define global symbolic names for the 'c54x registers.  Supposedly
     equivalent to executing `.set' directives for each register with
     its memory-mapped value, but in reality is provided only for
     compatibility and does nothing.

`.newblock'
     This directive resets any TIC54X local labels currently defined.
     Normal `as' local labels are unaffected.

`.option OPTION_LIST'
     Set listing options.  Ignored.

`.sblock "SECTION_NAME" | SECTION_NAME [,"NAME_N" | NAME_N]'
     Designate SECTION_NAME for blocking.  Blocking guarantees that a
     section will start on a page boundary (128 words) if it would
     otherwise cross a page boundary.  Only initialized sections may be
     designated with this directive.  See also *Note TIC54X-Block::.

`.sect "SECTION_NAME"'
     Define a named initialized section and make it the current section.

`SYMBOL .set "VALUE"'
`SYMBOL .equ "VALUE"'
     Equate a constant VALUE to a SYMBOL, which is placed in the symbol
     table.  SYMBOL may not be previously defined.

`.space SIZE_IN_BITS'
`.bes SIZE_IN_BITS'
     Reserve the given number of bits in the current section and
     zero-fill them.  If a label is used with `.space', it points to the
     *first* word reserved.  With `.bes', the label points to the
     *last* word reserved.

`.sslist'
`.ssnolist'
     Controls the inclusion of subsym replacement in the listing
     output.  Ignored.

`.string "STRING" [,...,"STRING_N"]'
`.pstring "STRING" [,...,"STRING_N"]'
     Place 8-bit characters from STRING into the current section.
     `.string' zero-fills the upper 8 bits of each word, while
     `.pstring' puts two characters into each word, filling the
     most-significant bits first.  Unused space is zero-filled.  If a
     label is used, it points to the first word initialized.

`[STAG] .struct [OFFSET]'
`[NAME_1] element [COUNT_1]'
`[NAME_2] element [COUNT_2]'
`[TNAME] .tag STAGX [TCOUNT]'
`...'
`[NAME_N] element [COUNT_N]'
`[SSIZE] .endstruct'
`LABEL .tag [STAG]'
     Assign symbolic offsets to the elements of a structure.  STAG
     defines a symbol to use to reference the structure.  OFFSET
     indicates a starting value to use for the first element
     encountered; otherwise it defaults to zero.  Each element can have
     a named offset, NAME, which is a symbol assigned the value of the
     element's offset into the structure.  If STAG is missing, these
     become global symbols.  COUNT adjusts the offset that many times,
     as if `element' were an array.  `element' may be one of `.byte',
     `.word', `.long', `.float', or any equivalent of those, and the
     structure offset is adjusted accordingly.  `.field' and `.string'
     are also allowed; the size of `.field' is one bit, and `.string'
     is considered to be one word in size.  Only element descriptors,
     structure/union tags, `.align' and conditional assembly directives
     are allowed within `.struct'/`.endstruct'.  `.align' aligns member
     offsets to word boundaries only.  SSIZE, if provided, will always
     be assigned the size of the structure.

     The `.tag' directive, in addition to being used to define a
     structure/union element within a structure, may be used to apply a
     structure to a symbol.  Once applied to LABEL, the individual
     structure elements may be applied to LABEL to produce the desired
     offsets using LABEL as the structure base.

`.tab'
     Set the tab size in the output listing.  Ignored.

`[UTAG] .union'
`[NAME_1] element [COUNT_1]'
`[NAME_2] element [COUNT_2]'
`[TNAME] .tag UTAGX[,TCOUNT]'
`...'
`[NAME_N] element [COUNT_N]'
`[USIZE] .endstruct'
`LABEL .tag [UTAG]'
     Similar to `.struct', but the offset after each element is reset to
     zero, and the USIZE is set to the maximum of all defined elements.
     Starting offset for the union is always zero.

`[SYMBOL] .usect "SECTION_NAME", SIZE, [,[BLOCKING_FLAG] [,ALIGNMENT_FLAG]]'
     Reserve space for variables in a named, uninitialized section
     (similar to .bss).  `.usect' allows definitions sections
     independent of .bss.  SYMBOL points to the first location reserved
     by this allocation.  The symbol may be used as a variable name.
     SIZE is the allocated size in words.  BLOCKING_FLAG indicates
     whether to block this section on a page boundary (128 words)
     (*note TIC54X-Block::).  ALIGNMENT FLAG indicates whether the
     section should be longword-aligned.

`.var SYM[,..., SYM_N]'
     Define a subsym to be a local variable within a macro.  See *Note
     TIC54X-Macros::.

`.version VERSION'
     Set which processor to build instructions for.  Though the
     following values are accepted, the op is ignored.
    `541'
    `542'
    `543'
    `545'
    `545LP'
    `546LP'
    `548'

8.29.10 Macros
--------------

Macros do not require explicit dereferencing of arguments (i.e. \ARG).

   During macro expansion, the macro parameters are converted to
subsyms.  If the number of arguments passed the macro invocation
exceeds the number of parameters defined, the last parameter is
assigned the string equivalent of all remaining arguments.  If fewer
arguments are given than parameters, the missing parameters are
assigned empty strings.  To include a comma in an argument, you must
enclose the argument in quotes.

   The following built-in subsym functions allow examination of the
string value of subsyms (or ordinary strings).  The arguments are
strings unless otherwise indicated (subsyms passed as args will be
replaced by the strings they represent).
``$symlen(STR)''
     Returns the length of STR.

``$symcmp(STR1,STR2)''
     Returns 0 if STR1 == STR2, non-zero otherwise.

``$firstch(STR,CH)''
     Returns index of the first occurrence of character constant CH in
     STR.

``$lastch(STR,CH)''
     Returns index of the last occurrence of character constant CH in
     STR.

``$isdefed(SYMBOL)''
     Returns zero if the symbol SYMBOL is not in the symbol table,
     non-zero otherwise.

``$ismember(SYMBOL,LIST)''
     Assign the first member of comma-separated string LIST to SYMBOL;
     LIST is reassigned the remainder of the list.  Returns zero if
     LIST is a null string.  Both arguments must be subsyms.

``$iscons(EXPR)''
     Returns 1 if string EXPR is binary, 2 if octal, 3 if hexadecimal,
     4 if a character, 5 if decimal, and zero if not an integer.

``$isname(NAME)''
     Returns 1 if NAME is a valid symbol name, zero otherwise.

``$isreg(REG)''
     Returns 1 if REG is a valid predefined register name (AR0-AR7
     only).

``$structsz(STAG)''
     Returns the size of the structure or union represented by STAG.

``$structacc(STAG)''
     Returns the reference point of the structure or union represented
     by STAG.   Always returns zero.

8.30.1 Options
--------------

The Zilog Z80 and Ascii R800 version of `as' have a few machine
dependent options.
`-z80'
     Produce code for the Z80 processor. There are additional options to
     request warnings and error messages for undocumented instructions.

`-ignore-undocumented-instructions'
`-Wnud'
     Silently assemble undocumented Z80-instructions that have been
     adopted as documented R800-instructions.

`-ignore-unportable-instructions'
`-Wnup'
     Silently assemble all undocumented Z80-instructions.

`-warn-undocumented-instructions'
`-Wud'
     Issue warnings for undocumented Z80-instructions that work on
     R800, do not assemble other undocumented instructions without
     warning.

`-warn-unportable-instructions'
`-Wup'
     Issue warnings for other undocumented Z80-instructions, do not
     treat any undocumented instructions as errors.

`-forbid-undocumented-instructions'
`-Fud'
     Treat all undocumented z80-instructions as errors.

`-forbid-unportable-instructions'
`-Fup'
     Treat undocumented z80-instructions that do not work on R800 as
     errors.

`-r800'
     Produce code for the R800 processor. The assembler does not support
     undocumented instructions for the R800.  In line with common
     practice, `as' uses Z80 instriction names for the R800 processor,
     as far as they exist.

8.30.2 Syntax
-------------

The assembler syntax closely follows the 'Z80 family CPU User Manual' by
Zilog.  In expressions a single `=' may be used as "is equal to"
comparison operator.

   Suffices can be used to indicate the radix of integer constants; `H'
or `h' for hexadecimal, `D' or `d' for decimal, `Q', `O', `q' or `o'
for octal, and `B' for binary.

   The suffix `b' denotes a backreference to local label.

8.30.2.1 Special Characters
...........................

The semicolon `;' is the line comment character;

   The dollar sign `$' can be used as a prefix for hexadecimal numbers
and as a symbol denoting the current location counter.

   A backslash `\' is an ordinary character for the Z80 assembler.

   The single quote `'' must be followed by a closing quote. If there
is one character inbetween, it is a character constant, otherwise it is
a string constant.


File: as.info,  Node: Z80-Regs,  Next: Z80-Case,  Prev: Z80-Chars,  Up: Z80 Syntax

8.30.2.2 Register Names
.......................

The registers are referred to with the letters assigned to them by
Zilog. In addition `as' recognises `ixl' and `ixh' as the least and
most significant octet in `ix', and similarly `iyl' and  `iyh' as parts
of `iy'.


File: as.info,  Node: Z80-Case,  Prev: Z80-Regs,  Up: Z80 Syntax

8.30.2.3 Case Sensitivity
.........................

Upper and lower case are equivalent in register names, opcodes,
condition codes  and assembler directives.  The case of letters is
significant in labels and symbol names. The case is also important to
distinguish the suffix `b' for a backward reference to a local label
from the suffix `B' for a number in binary notation.

8.30.4 Z80 Assembler Directives
-------------------------------

`as' for the Z80 supports some additional directives for compatibility
with other assemblers.

   These are the additional directives in `as' for the Z80:

`db EXPRESSION|STRING[,EXPRESSION|STRING...]'
`defb EXPRESSION|STRING[,EXPRESSION|STRING...]'
     For each STRING the characters are copied to the object file, for
     each other EXPRESSION the value is stored in one byte.  A warning
     is issued in case of an overflow.

`dw EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
`defw EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
     For each EXPRESSION the value is stored in two bytes, ignoring
     overflow.

`d24 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
`def24 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
     For each EXPRESSION the value is stored in three bytes, ignoring
     overflow.

`d32 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
`def32 EXPRESSION[,EXPRESSION...]'
     For each EXPRESSION the value is stored in four bytes, ignoring
     overflow.

`ds COUNT[, VALUE]'
`defs COUNT[, VALUE]'
     Fill COUNT bytes in the object file with VALUE, if VALUE is
     omitted it defaults to zero.

`SYMBOL equ EXPRESSION'
`SYMBOL defl EXPRESSION'
     These directives set the value of SYMBOL to EXPRESSION. If `equ'
     is used, it is an error if SYMBOL is already defined.  Symbols
     defined with `equ' are not protected from redefinition.

`set'
     This is a normal instruction on Z80, and not an assembler
     directive.

`psect NAME'
     A synonym for *Note Section::, no second argument should be given.



File: as.info,  Node: Z80 Opcodes,  Prev: Z80 Directives,  Up: Z80-Dependent

8.30.5 Opcodes
--------------

In line with commmon practice Z80 mnonics are used for both the Z80 and
the R800.

   In many instructions it is possible to use one of the half index
registers (`ixl',`ixh',`iyl',`iyh') in stead of an 8-bit general
purpose register. This yields instructions that are documented on the
R800 and undocumented on the Z80.  Similarly `in f,(c)' is documented
on the R800 and undocumented on the Z80.

   The assembler also supports the following undocumented
Z80-instructions, that have not been adopted in the R800 instruction
set:
`out (c),0'
     Sends zero to the port pointed to by register c.

`sli M'
     Equivalent to `M = (M<<1)+1', the operand M can be any operand
     that is valid for `sla'. One can use `sll' as a synonym for `sli'.

`OP (ix+D), R'
     This is equivalent to

          ld R, (ix+D)
          OPC R
          ld (ix+D), R

     The operation `OPC' may be any of `res B,', `set B,', `rl', `rlc',
     `rr', `rrc', `sla', `sli', `sra' and `srl', and the register `R'
     may be any of `a', `b', `c', `d', `e', `h' and `l'.

`OPC (iy+D), R'
     As above, but with `iy' instead of `ix'.

   The web site at `http://www.z80.info' is a good starting place to
find more information on programming the Z80.

8.31 Z8000 Dependent Features
=============================

   The Z8000 as supports both members of the Z8000 family: the
unsegmented Z8002, with 16 bit addresses, and the segmented Z8001 with
24 bit addresses.

   When the assembler is in unsegmented mode (specified with the
`unsegm' directive), an address takes up one word (16 bit) sized
register.  When the assembler is in segmented mode (specified with the
`segm' directive), a 24-bit address takes up a long (32 bit) register.

The Z8000 has sixteen 16 bit registers, numbered 0 to 15.  You can refer
to different sized groups of registers by register number, with the
prefix `r' for 16 bit registers, `rr' for 32 bit registers and `rq' for
64 bit registers.  You can also refer to the contents of the first
eight (of the sixteen 16 bit registers) by bytes.  They are named `rlN'
and `rhN'.

8.31.2.3 Addressing Modes
.........................

as understands the following addressing modes for the Z8000:

`rlN'
`rhN'
`rN'
`rrN'
`rqN'
     Register direct:  8bit, 16bit, 32bit, and 64bit registers.

`@@rN'
`@@rrN'
     Indirect register:  @@rrN in segmented mode, @@rN in unsegmented
     mode.

`ADDR'
     Direct: the 16 bit or 24 bit address (depending on whether the
     assembler is in segmented or unsegmented mode) of the operand is
     in the instruction.

`address(rN)'
     Indexed: the 16 or 24 bit address is added to the 16 bit register
     to produce the final address in memory of the operand.

`rN(#IMM)'
`rrN(#IMM)'
     Base Address: the 16 or 24 bit register is added to the 16 bit sign
     extended immediate displacement to produce the final address in
     memory of the operand.

`rN(rM)'
`rrN(rM)'
     Base Index: the 16 or 24 bit register rN or rrN is added to the
     sign extended 16 bit index register rM to produce the final
     address in memory of the operand.

`#XX'
     Immediate data XX.

8.31.3 Assembler Directives for the Z8000
-----------------------------------------

The Z8000 port of as includes additional assembler directives, for
compatibility with other Z8000 assemblers.  These do not begin with `.'
(unlike the ordinary as directives).

`segm'
`.z8001'
     Generate code for the segmented Z8001.

`unsegm'
`.z8002'
     Generate code for the unsegmented Z8002.

`name'
     Synonym for `.file'

`global'
     Synonym for `.global'

`wval'
     Synonym for `.word'

`lval'
     Synonym for `.long'

`bval'
     Synonym for `.byte'

`sval'
     Assemble a string.  `sval' expects one string literal, delimited by
     single quotes.  It assembles each byte of the string into
     consecutive addresses.  You can use the escape sequence `%XX'
     (where XX represents a two-digit hexadecimal number) to represent
     the character whose ASCII value is XX.  Use this feature to
     describe single quote and other characters that may not appear in
     string literals as themselves.  For example, the C statement
     `char *a = "he said \"it's 50% off\"";' is represented in Z8000
     assembly language (shown with the assembler output in hex at the
     left) as

          68652073    sval    'he said %22it%27s 50%25 off%22%00'
          61696420

          73203530
          25206F66
          662200

`rsect'
     synonym for `.section'

`block'
     synonym for `.space'

`even'
     special case of `.align'; aligns output to even byte boundary.

File: as.info,  Node: VAX-Opts,  Next: VAX-float,  Up: Vax-Dependent

8.32.1 VAX Command-Line Options
-------------------------------

The Vax version of `as' accepts any of the following options, gives a
warning message that the option was ignored and proceeds.  These
options are for compatibility with scripts designed for other people's
assemblers.

``-D' (Debug)'
``-S' (Symbol Table)'
``-T' (Token Trace)'
     These are obsolete options used to debug old assemblers.

``-d' (Displacement size for JUMPs)'
     This option expects a number following the `-d'.  Like options
     that expect filenames, the number may immediately follow the `-d'
     (old standard) or constitute the whole of the command line
     argument that follows `-d' (GNU standard).

``-V' (Virtualize Interpass Temporary File)'
     Some other assemblers use a temporary file.  This option commanded
     them to keep the information in active memory rather than in a
     disk file.  `as' always does this, so this option is redundant.

``-J' (JUMPify Longer Branches)'
     Many 32-bit computers permit a variety of branch instructions to
     do the same job.  Some of these instructions are short (and fast)
     but have a limited range; others are long (and slow) but can
     branch anywhere in virtual memory.  Often there are 3 flavors of
     branch: short, medium and long.  Some other assemblers would emit
     short and medium branches, unless told by this option to emit
     short and long branches.

``-t' (Temporary File Directory)'
     Some other assemblers may use a temporary file, and this option
     takes a filename being the directory to site the temporary file.
     Since `as' does not use a temporary disk file, this option makes
     no difference.  `-t' needs exactly one filename.

   The Vax version of the assembler accepts additional options when
compiled for VMS:

`-h N'
     External symbol or section (used for global variables) names are
     not case sensitive on VAX/VMS and always mapped to upper case.
     This is contrary to the C language definition which explicitly
     distinguishes upper and lower case.  To implement a standard
     conforming C compiler, names must be changed (mapped) to preserve
     the case information.  The default mapping is to convert all lower
     case characters to uppercase and adding an underscore followed by
     a 6 digit hex value, representing a 24 digit binary value.  The
     one digits in the binary value represent which characters are
     uppercase in the original symbol name.

     The `-h N' option determines how we map names.  This takes several
     values.  No `-h' switch at all allows case hacking as described
     above.  A value of zero (`-h0') implies names should be upper
     case, and inhibits the case hack.  A value of 2 (`-h2') implies
     names should be all lower case, with no case hack.  A value of 3
     (`-h3') implies that case should be preserved.  The value 1 is
     unused.  The `-H' option directs `as' to display every mapped
     symbol during assembly.

     Symbols whose names include a dollar sign `$' are exceptions to the
     general name mapping.  These symbols are normally only used to
     reference VMS library names.  Such symbols are always mapped to
     upper case.

`-+'
     The `-+' option causes `as' to truncate any symbol name larger
     than 31 characters.  The `-+' option also prevents some code
     following the `_main' symbol normally added to make the object
     file compatible with Vax-11 "C".

`-1'
     This option is ignored for backward compatibility with `as'
     version 1.x.

`-H'
     The `-H' option causes `as' to print every symbol which was
     changed by case mapping.

8.32.2 VAX Floating Point
-------------------------

Conversion of flonums to floating point is correct, and compatible with
previous assemblers.  Rounding is towards zero if the remainder is
exactly half the least significant bit.

   `D', `F', `G' and `H' floating point formats are understood.

   Immediate floating literals (_e.g._ `S`$6.9') are rendered
correctly.  Again, rounding is towards zero in the boundary case.

   The `.float' directive produces `f' format numbers.  The `.double'
directive produces `d' format numbers.

8.32.3 Vax Machine Directives
-----------------------------

The Vax version of the assembler supports four directives for
generating Vax floating point constants.  They are described in the
table below.

`.dfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `d' format 64-bit floating point constants.

`.ffloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `f' format 32-bit floating point constants.

`.gfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `g' format 64-bit floating point constants.

`.hfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `h' format 128-bit floating point constants.

8.32.4 VAX Opcodes
------------------

All DEC mnemonics are supported.  Beware that `case...' instructions
have exactly 3 operands.  The dispatch table that follows the `case...'
instruction should be made with `.word' statements.  This is compatible
with all unix assemblers we know of.

8.32.5 VAX Branch Improvement
-----------------------------

Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted.  They are for branch
instructions.  They expand to the shortest branch instruction that
reaches the target.  Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting
`j' for `b' at the start of a DEC mnemonic.  This feature is included
both for compatibility and to help compilers.  If you do not need this
feature, avoid these opcodes.  Here are the mnemonics, and the code
they can expand into.

`jbsb'
     `Jsb' is already an instruction mnemonic, so we chose `jbsb'.
    (byte displacement)
          `bsbb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bsbw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jsb ...'

`jbr'
`jr'
     Unconditional branch.
    (byte displacement)
          `brb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `brw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jmp ...'

`jCOND'
     COND may be any one of the conditional branches `neq', `nequ',
     `eql', `eqlu', `gtr', `geq', `lss', `gtru', `lequ', `vc', `vs',
     `gequ', `cc', `lssu', `cs'.  COND may also be one of the bit tests
     `bs', `bc', `bss', `bcs', `bsc', `bcc', `bssi', `bcci', `lbs',
     `lbc'.  NOTCOND is the opposite condition to COND.
    (byte displacement)
          `bCOND ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bNOTCOND foo ; brw ... ; foo:'

    (long displacement)
          `bNOTCOND foo ; jmp ... ; foo:'

`jacbX'
     X may be one of `b d f g h l w'.
    (word displacement)
          `OPCODE ...'

    (long displacement)
               OPCODE ..., foo ;
               brb bar ;
               foo: jmp ... ;
               bar:

`jaobYYY'
     YYY may be one of `lss leq'.

`jsobZZZ'
     ZZZ may be one of `geq gtr'.

8.32.6 VAX Operands
-------------------

The immediate character is `$' for Unix compatibility, not `#' as DEC
writes it.

   The indirect character is `*' for Unix compatibility, not `@@' as DEC
writes it.

   The displacement sizing character is ``' (an accent grave) for Unix
compatibility, not `^' as DEC writes it.  The letter preceding ``' may
have either case.  `G' is not understood, but all other letters (`b i l
s w') are understood.

   Register names understood are `r0 r1 r2 ... r15 ap fp sp pc'.  Upper
and lower case letters are equivalent.

   For instance
     tstb *w`$4(r5)

   Any expression is permitted in an operand.  Operands are comma
separated.

8.33.1 Options
--------------

`as' supports the following additional command-line options for the
V850 processor family:

`-wsigned_overflow'
     Causes warnings to be produced when signed immediate values
     overflow the space available for then within their opcodes.  By
     default this option is disabled as it is possible to receive
     spurious warnings due to using exact bit patterns as immediate
     constants.

`-wunsigned_overflow'
     Causes warnings to be produced when unsigned immediate values
     overflow the space available for then within their opcodes.  By
     default this option is disabled as it is possible to receive
     spurious warnings due to using exact bit patterns as immediate
     constants.

`-mv850'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850e'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850e1'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E1 processor.  This allows the linker to
     detect attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850any'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor but support instructions that are
     specific to the extended variants of the process.  This allows the
     production of binaries that contain target specific code, but
     which are also intended to be used in a generic fashion.  For
     example libgcc.a contains generic routines used by the code
     produced by GCC for all versions of the v850 architecture,
     together with support routines only used by the V850E architecture.

`-mrelax'
     Enables relaxation.  This allows the .longcall and .longjump pseudo
     ops to be used in the assembler source code.  These ops label
     sections of code which are either a long function call or a long
     branch.  The assembler will then flag these sections of code and
     the linker will attempt to relax them.

File: as.info,  Node: V850 Opcodes,  Prev: V850 Directives,  Up: V850-Dependent

8.33.5 Opcodes
--------------

`as' implements all the standard V850 opcodes.

   `as' also implements the following pseudo ops:

`hi0()'
     Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `mulhi hi0(here - there), r5, r6'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the upper 16 bits of this difference, shifts it
     down 16 bits and then mutliplies it by the lower 16 bits in
     register 5, putting the result into register 6.

`lo()'
     Computes the lower 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `addi lo(here - there), r5, r6'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the lower 16 bits of this difference and adds it to
     register 5, putting the result into register 6.

`hi()'
     Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and then adds
     the value of the most significant bit of the lower 16 bits of the
     expression and stores the result into the immediate operand field
     of the given instruction.  For example the following code can be
     used to compute the address of the label 'here' and store it into
     register 6:

     `movhi hi(here), r0, r6'     `movea lo(here), r6, r6'

     The reason for this special behaviour is that movea performs a sign
     extension on its immediate operand.  So for example if the address
     of 'here' was 0xFFFFFFFF then without the special behaviour of the
     hi() pseudo-op the movhi instruction would put 0xFFFF0000 into r6,
     then the movea instruction would takes its immediate operand,
     0xFFFF, sign extend it to 32 bits, 0xFFFFFFFF, and then add it
     into r6 giving 0xFFFEFFFF which is wrong (the fifth nibble is E).
     With the hi() pseudo op adding in the top bit of the lo() pseudo
     op, the movhi instruction actually stores 0 into r6 (0xFFFF + 1 =
     0x0000), so that the movea instruction stores 0xFFFFFFFF into r6 -
     the right value.

`hilo()'
     Computes the 32 bit value of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction (which
     must be a mov instruction).  For example:

     `mov hilo(here), r6'

     computes the absolute address of label 'here' and puts the result
     into register 6.

`sdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Small Data Area (whoes address is held in register 4, the GP
     register) and stores the result as a 16 bit signed value in the
     immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For example:

     `ld.w sdaoff(_a_variable)[gp],r6'

     loads the contents of the location pointed to by the label
     '_a_variable' into register 6, provided that the label is located
     somewhere within +/- 32K of the address held in the GP register.
     [Note the linker assumes that the GP register contains a fixed
     address set to the address of the label called '__gp'.  This can
     either be set up automatically by the linker, or specifically set
     by using the `--defsym __gp=<value>' command line option].

`tdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Tiny Data Area (whoes address is held in register 30, the EP
     register) and stores the result as a 4,5, 7 or 8 bit unsigned
     value in the immediate operand field of the given instruction.
     For example:

     `sld.w tdaoff(_a_variable)[ep],r6'

     loads the contents of the location pointed to by the label
     '_a_variable' into register 6, provided that the label is located
     somewhere within +256 bytes of the address held in the EP
     register.  [Note the linker assumes that the EP register contains
     a fixed address set to the address of the label called '__ep'.
     This can either be set up automatically by the linker, or
     specifically set by using the `--defsym __ep=<value>' command line
     option].

`zdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from address 0 and
     stores the result as a 16 bit signed value in the immediate
     operand field of the given instruction.  For example:

     `movea zdaoff(_a_variable),zero,r6'

     puts the address of the label '_a_variable' into register 6,
     assuming that the label is somewhere within the first 32K of
     memory.  (Strictly speaking it also possible to access the last
     32K of memory as well, as the offsets are signed).

`ctoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Call Table Area (whoes address is helg in system register 20, the
     CTBP register) and stores the result a 6 or 16 bit unsigned value
     in the immediate field of then given instruction or piece of data.
     For example:

     `callt ctoff(table_func1)'

     will put the call the function whoes address is held in the call
     table at the location labeled 'table_func1'.

`.longcall `name''
     Indicates that the following sequence of instructions is a long
     call to function `name'.  The linker will attempt to shorten this
     call sequence if `name' is within a 22bit offset of the call.  Only
     valid if the `-mrelax' command line switch has been enabled.

`.longjump `name''
     Indicates that the following sequence of instructions is a long
     jump to label `name'.  The linker will attempt to shorten this code
     sequence if `name' is within a 22bit offset of the jump.  Only
     valid if the `-mrelax' command line switch has been enabled.

8.34.1 Command Line Options
---------------------------

The Xtensa version of the GNU assembler supports these special options:

`--text-section-literals | --no-text-section-literals'
     Control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
     `--no-text-section-literals', which places literals in a separate
     section in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be
     placed in a data RAM/ROM.  With `--text-section-literals', the
     literals are interspersed in the text section in order to keep
     them as close as possible to their references.  This may be
     necessary for large assembly files, where the literals would
     otherwise be out of range of the `L32R' instructions in the text
     section.  These options only affect literals referenced via
     PC-relative `L32R' instructions; literals for absolute mode `L32R'
     instructions are handled separately.

`--absolute-literals | --no-absolute-literals'
     Indicate to the assembler whether `L32R' instructions use absolute
     or PC-relative addressing.  If the processor includes the absolute
     addressing option, the default is to use absolute `L32R'
     relocations.  Otherwise, only the PC-relative `L32R' relocations
     can be used.

`--target-align | --no-target-align'
     Enable or disable automatic alignment to reduce branch penalties
     at some expense in code size.  *Note Automatic Instruction
     Alignment: Xtensa Automatic Alignment.  This optimization is
     enabled by default.  Note that the assembler will always align
     instructions like `LOOP' that have fixed alignment requirements.

`--longcalls | --no-longcalls'
     Enable or disable transformation of call instructions to allow
     calls across a greater range of addresses.  *Note Function Call
     Relaxation: Xtensa Call Relaxation.  This option should be used
     when call targets can potentially be out of range.  It may degrade
     both code size and performance, but the linker can generally
     optimize away the unnecessary overhead when a call ends up within
     range.  The default is `--no-longcalls'.

`--transform | --no-transform'
     Enable or disable all assembler transformations of Xtensa
     instructions, including both relaxation and optimization.  The
     default is `--transform'; `--no-transform' should only be used in
     the rare cases when the instructions must be exactly as specified
     in the assembly source.  Using `--no-transform' causes out of range
     instruction operands to be errors.

`--rename-section OLDNAME=NEWNAME'
     Rename the OLDNAME section to NEWNAME.  This option can be used
     multiple times to rename multiple sections.

8.34.2 Assembler Syntax
-----------------------

Block comments are delimited by `/*' and `*/'.  End of line comments
may be introduced with either `#' or `//'.

   Instructions consist of a leading opcode or macro name followed by
whitespace and an optional comma-separated list of operands:

     OPCODE [OPERAND, ...]

   Instructions must be separated by a newline or semicolon.

   FLIX instructions, which bundle multiple opcodes together in a single
instruction, are specified by enclosing the bundled opcodes inside
braces:

     {
     [FORMAT]
     OPCODE0 [OPERANDS]
     OPCODE1 [OPERANDS]
     OPCODE2 [OPERANDS]
     ...
     }

   The opcodes in a FLIX instruction are listed in the same order as the
corresponding instruction slots in the TIE format declaration.
Directives and labels are not allowed inside the braces of a FLIX
instruction.  A particular TIE format name can optionally be specified
immediately after the opening brace, but this is usually unnecessary.
The assembler will automatically search for a format that can encode the
specified opcodes, so the format name need only be specified in rare
cases where there is more than one applicable format and where it
matters which of those formats is used.  A FLIX instruction can also be
specified on a single line by separating the opcodes with semicolons:

     { [FORMAT;] OPCODE0 [OPERANDS]; OPCODE1 [OPERANDS]; OPCODE2 [OPERANDS]; ... }

   The assembler can automatically bundle opcodes into FLIX
instructions.  It encodes the opcodes in order, one at a time, choosing
the smallest format where each opcode can be encoded and filling unused
instruction slots with no-ops.

8.34.2.1 Opcode Names
.....................

See the `Xtensa Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Reference Manual'
for a complete list of opcodes and descriptions of their semantics.

   If an opcode name is prefixed with an underscore character (`_'),
`as' will not transform that instruction in any way.  The underscore
prefix disables both optimization (*note Xtensa Optimizations: Xtensa
Optimizations.) and relaxation (*note Xtensa Relaxation: Xtensa
Relaxation.) for that particular instruction.  Only use the underscore
prefix when it is essential to select the exact opcode produced by the
assembler.  Using this feature unnecessarily makes the code less
efficient by disabling assembler optimization and less flexible by
disabling relaxation.

   Note that this special handling of underscore prefixes only applies
to Xtensa opcodes, not to either built-in macros or user-defined macros.
When an underscore prefix is used with a macro (e.g., `_MOV'), it
refers to a different macro.  The assembler generally provides built-in
macros both with and without the underscore prefix, where the underscore
versions behave as if the underscore carries through to the instructions
in the macros.  For example, `_MOV' may expand to `_MOV.N'.

   The underscore prefix only applies to individual instructions, not to
series of instructions.  For example, if a series of instructions have
underscore prefixes, the assembler will not transform the individual
instructions, but it may insert other instructions between them (e.g.,
to align a `LOOP' instruction).  To prevent the assembler from
modifying a series of instructions as a whole, use the `no-transform'
directive.  *Note transform: Transform Directive.

8.34.2.2 Register Names
.......................

The assembly syntax for a register file entry is the "short" name for a
TIE register file followed by the index into that register file.  For
example, the general-purpose `AR' register file has a short name of
`a', so these registers are named `a0'...`a15'.  As a special feature,
`sp' is also supported as a synonym for `a1'.  Additional registers may
be added by processor configuration options and by designer-defined TIE
extensions.  An initial `$' character is optional in all register names.

8.34.3 Xtensa Optimizations
---------------------------

The optimizations currently supported by `as' are generation of density
instructions where appropriate and automatic branch target alignment.

* Density Instructions::        Using Density Instructions.
* Xtensa Automatic Alignment::  Automatic Instruction Alignment.


File: as.info,  Node: Density Instructions,  Next: Xtensa Automatic Alignment,  Up: Xtensa Optimizations

8.34.3.1 Using Density Instructions
...................................

The Xtensa instruction set has a code density option that provides
16-bit versions of some of the most commonly used opcodes.  Use of these
opcodes can significantly reduce code size.  When possible, the
assembler automatically translates instructions from the core Xtensa
instruction set into equivalent instructions from the Xtensa code
density option.  This translation can be disabled by using underscore
prefixes (*note Opcode Names: Xtensa Opcodes.), by using the
`--no-transform' command-line option (*note Command Line Options:
Xtensa Options.), or by using the `no-transform' directive (*note
transform: Transform Directive.).

   It is a good idea _not_ to use the density instructions directly.
The assembler will automatically select dense instructions where
possible.  If you later need to use an Xtensa processor without the code
density option, the same assembly code will then work without
modification.


File: as.info,  Node: Xtensa Automatic Alignment,  Prev: Density Instructions,  Up: Xtensa Optimizations

8.34.3.2 Automatic Instruction Alignment
........................................

The Xtensa assembler will automatically align certain instructions, both
to optimize performance and to satisfy architectural requirements.

   As an optimization to improve performance, the assembler attempts to
align branch targets so they do not cross instruction fetch boundaries.
(Xtensa processors can be configured with either 32-bit or 64-bit
instruction fetch widths.)  An instruction immediately following a call
is treated as a branch target in this context, because it will be the
target of a return from the call.  This alignment has the potential to
reduce branch penalties at some expense in code size.  The assembler
will not attempt to align labels with the prefixes `.Ln' and `.LM',
since these labels are used for debugging information and are not
typically branch targets.  This optimization is enabled by default.
You can disable it with the `--no-target-align' command-line option
(*note Command Line Options: Xtensa Options.).

   The target alignment optimization is done without adding instructions
that could increase the execution time of the program.  If there are
density instructions in the code preceding a target, the assembler can
change the target alignment by widening some of those instructions to
the equivalent 24-bit instructions.  Extra bytes of padding can be
inserted immediately following unconditional jump and return
instructions.  This approach is usually successful in aligning many,
but not all, branch targets.

   The `LOOP' family of instructions must be aligned such that the
first instruction in the loop body does not cross an instruction fetch
boundary (e.g., with a 32-bit fetch width, a `LOOP' instruction must be
on either a 1 or 2 mod 4 byte boundary).  The assembler knows about
this restriction and inserts the minimal number of 2 or 3 byte no-op
instructions to satisfy it.  When no-op instructions are added, any
label immediately preceding the original loop will be moved in order to
refer to the loop instruction, not the newly generated no-op
instruction.  To preserve binary compatibility across processors with
different fetch widths, the assembler conservatively assumes a 32-bit
fetch width when aligning `LOOP' instructions (except if the first
instruction in the loop is a 64-bit instruction).

   Similarly, the `ENTRY' instruction must be aligned on a 0 mod 4 byte
boundary.  The assembler satisfies this requirement by inserting zero
bytes when required.  In addition, labels immediately preceding the
`ENTRY' instruction will be moved to the newly aligned instruction
location.

8.34.4 Xtensa Relaxation
------------------------

When an instruction operand is outside the range allowed for that
particular instruction field, `as' can transform the code to use a
functionally-equivalent instruction or sequence of instructions.  This
process is known as "relaxation".  This is typically done for branch
instructions because the distance of the branch targets is not known
until assembly-time.  The Xtensa assembler offers branch relaxation and
also extends this concept to function calls, `MOVI' instructions and
other instructions with immediate fields.

* Menu:

* Xtensa Branch Relaxation::        Relaxation of Branches.
* Xtensa Call Relaxation::          Relaxation of Function Calls.
* Xtensa Immediate Relaxation::     Relaxation of other Immediate Fields.

8.34.4.1 Conditional Branch Relaxation
......................................

When the target of a branch is too far away from the branch itself,
i.e., when the offset from the branch to the target is too large to fit
in the immediate field of the branch instruction, it may be necessary to
replace the branch with a branch around a jump.  For example,

         beqz    a2, L

   may result in:

         bnez.n  a2, M
         j L
     M:

   (The `BNEZ.N' instruction would be used in this example only if the
density option is available.  Otherwise, `BNEZ' would be used.)

   This relaxation works well because the unconditional jump instruction
has a much larger offset range than the various conditional branches.
However, an error will occur if a branch target is beyond the range of a
jump instruction.  `as' cannot relax unconditional jumps.  Similarly,
an error will occur if the original input contains an unconditional
jump to a target that is out of range.

   Branch relaxation is enabled by default.  It can be disabled by using
underscore prefixes (*note Opcode Names: Xtensa Opcodes.), the
`--no-transform' command-line option (*note Command Line Options:
Xtensa Options.), or the `no-transform' directive (*note transform:
Transform Directive.).


File: as.info,  Node: Xtensa Call Relaxation,  Next: Xtensa Immediate Relaxation,  Prev: Xtensa Branch Relaxation,  Up: Xtensa Relaxation

8.34.4.2 Function Call Relaxation
.................................

Function calls may require relaxation because the Xtensa immediate call
instructions (`CALL0', `CALL4', `CALL8' and `CALL12') provide a
PC-relative offset of only 512 Kbytes in either direction.  For larger
programs, it may be necessary to use indirect calls (`CALLX0',
`CALLX4', `CALLX8' and `CALLX12') where the target address is specified
in a register.  The Xtensa assembler can automatically relax immediate
call instructions into indirect call instructions.  This relaxation is
done by loading the address of the called function into the callee's
return address register and then using a `CALLX' instruction.  So, for
example:

         call8 func

   might be relaxed to:

         .literal .L1, func
         l32r    a8, .L1
         callx8  a8

   Because the addresses of targets of function calls are not generally
known until link-time, the assembler must assume the worst and relax all
the calls to functions in other source files, not just those that really
will be out of range.  The linker can recognize calls that were
unnecessarily relaxed, and it will remove the overhead introduced by the
assembler for those cases where direct calls are sufficient.

   Call relaxation is disabled by default because it can have a negative
effect on both code size and performance, although the linker can
usually eliminate the unnecessary overhead.  If a program is too large
and some of the calls are out of range, function call relaxation can be
enabled using the `--longcalls' command-line option or the `longcalls'
directive (*note longcalls: Longcalls Directive.).


File: as.info,  Node: Xtensa Immediate Relaxation,  Prev: Xtensa Call Relaxation,  Up: Xtensa Relaxation

8.34.4.3 Other Immediate Field Relaxation
.........................................

The assembler normally performs the following other relaxations.  They
can be disabled by using underscore prefixes (*note Opcode Names:
Xtensa Opcodes.), the `--no-transform' command-line option (*note
Command Line Options: Xtensa Options.), or the `no-transform' directive
(*note transform: Transform Directive.).

   The `MOVI' machine instruction can only materialize values in the
range from -2048 to 2047.  Values outside this range are best
materialized with `L32R' instructions.  Thus:

         movi a0, 100000

   is assembled into the following machine code:

         .literal .L1, 100000
         l32r a0, .L1

   The `L8UI' machine instruction can only be used with immediate
offsets in the range from 0 to 255. The `L16SI' and `L16UI' machine
instructions can only be used with offsets from 0 to 510.  The `L32I'
machine instruction can only be used with offsets from 0 to 1020.  A
load offset outside these ranges can be materalized with an `L32R'
instruction if the destination register of the load is different than
the source address register.  For example:

         l32i a1, a0, 2040

   is translated to:

         .literal .L1, 2040
         l32r a1, .L1
         addi a1, a0, a1
         l32i a1, a1, 0

If the load destination and source address register are the same, an
out-of-range offset causes an error.

   The Xtensa `ADDI' instruction only allows immediate operands in the
range from -128 to 127.  There are a number of alternate instruction
sequences for the `ADDI' operation.  First, if the immediate is 0, the
`ADDI' will be turned into a `MOV.N' instruction (or the equivalent
`OR' instruction if the code density option is not available).  If the
`ADDI' immediate is outside of the range -128 to 127, but inside the
range -32896 to 32639, an `ADDMI' instruction or `ADDMI'/`ADDI'
sequence will be used.  Finally, if the immediate is outside of this
range and a free register is available, an `L32R'/`ADD' sequence will
be used with a literal allocated from the literal pool.

   For example:

         addi    a5, a6, 0
         addi    a5, a6, 512
         addi    a5, a6, 513
         addi    a5, a6, 50000

   is assembled into the following:

         .literal .L1, 50000
         mov.n   a5, a6
         addmi   a5, a6, 0x200
         addmi   a5, a6, 0x200
         addi    a5, a5, 1
         l32r    a5, .L1
         add     a5, a6, a5

8.34.5 Directives
-----------------

The Xtensa assember supports a region-based directive syntax:

         .begin DIRECTIVE [OPTIONS]
         ...
         .end DIRECTIVE

   All the Xtensa-specific directives that apply to a region of code use
this syntax.

   The directive applies to code between the `.begin' and the `.end'.
The state of the option after the `.end' reverts to what it was before
the `.begin'.  A nested `.begin'/`.end' region can further change the
state of the directive without having to be aware of its outer state.
For example, consider:

         .begin no-transform
     L:  add a0, a1, a2
         .begin transform
     M:  add a0, a1, a2
         .end transform
     N:  add a0, a1, a2
         .end no-transform

   The `ADD' opcodes at `L' and `N' in the outer `no-transform' region
both result in `ADD' machine instructions, but the assembler selects an
`ADD.N' instruction for the `ADD' at `M' in the inner `transform'
region.

   The advantage of this style is that it works well inside macros
which can preserve the context of their callers.

   The following directives are available:

* Menu:

* Schedule Directive::         Enable instruction scheduling.
* Longcalls Directive::        Use Indirect Calls for Greater Range.
* Transform Directive::        Disable All Assembler Transformations.
* Literal Directive::          Intermix Literals with Instructions.
* Literal Position Directive:: Specify Inline Literal Pool Locations.
* Literal Prefix Directive::   Specify Literal Section Name Prefix.
* Absolute Literals Directive:: Control PC-Relative vs. Absolute Literals.

8.34.5.1 schedule
.................

The `schedule' directive is recognized only for compatibility with
Tensilica's assembler.

         .begin [no-]schedule
         .end [no-]schedule

8.34.5.2 longcalls
..................

The `longcalls' directive enables or disables function call relaxation.
*Note Function Call Relaxation: Xtensa Call Relaxation.

         .begin [no-]longcalls
         .end [no-]longcalls

   Call relaxation is disabled by default unless the `--longcalls'
command-line option is specified.  The `longcalls' directive overrides
the default determined by the command-line options.

8.34.5.3 transform
..................

This directive enables or disables all assembler transformation,
including relaxation (*note Xtensa Relaxation: Xtensa Relaxation.) and
optimization (*note Xtensa Optimizations: Xtensa Optimizations.).

         .begin [no-]transform
         .end [no-]transform

   Transformations are enabled by default unless the `--no-transform'
option is used.  The `transform' directive overrides the default
determined by the command-line options.  An underscore opcode prefix,
disabling transformation of that opcode, always takes precedence over
both directives and command-line flags.


File: as.info,  Node: Literal Directive,  Next: Literal Position Directive,  Prev: Transform Directive,  Up: Xtensa Directives

8.34.5.4 literal
................

The `.literal' directive is used to define literal pool data, i.e.,
read-only 32-bit data accessed via `L32R' instructions.

         .literal LABEL, VALUE[, VALUE...]

   This directive is similar to the standard `.word' directive, except
that the actual location of the literal data is determined by the
assembler and linker, not by the position of the `.literal' directive.
Using this directive gives the assembler freedom to locate the literal
data in the most appropriate place and possibly to combine identical
literals.  For example, the code:

         entry sp, 40
         .literal .L1, sym
         l32r    a4, .L1

   can be used to load a pointer to the symbol `sym' into register
`a4'.  The value of `sym' will not be placed between the `ENTRY' and
`L32R' instructions; instead, the assembler puts the data in a literal
pool.

   Literal pools for absolute mode `L32R' instructions (*note Absolute
Literals Directive::) are placed in a separate `.lit4' section.  By
default literal pools for PC-relative mode `L32R' instructions are
placed in a separate `.literal' section; however, when using the
`--text-section-literals' option (*note Command Line Options: Xtensa
Options.), the literal pools are placed in the current section.  These
text section literal pools are created automatically before `ENTRY'
instructions and manually after `.literal_position' directives (*note
literal_position: Literal Position Directive.).  If there are no
preceding `ENTRY' instructions, explicit `.literal_position' directives
must be used to place the text section literal pools; otherwise, `as'
will report an error.


File: as.info,  Node: Literal Position Directive,  Next: Literal Prefix Directive,  Prev: Literal Directive,  Up: Xtensa Directives

8.34.5.5 literal_position
.........................

When using `--text-section-literals' to place literals inline in the
section being assembled, the `.literal_position' directive can be used
to mark a potential location for a literal pool.

         .literal_position

   The `.literal_position' directive is ignored when the
`--text-section-literals' option is not used or when `L32R'
instructions use the absolute addressing mode.

   The assembler will automatically place text section literal pools
before `ENTRY' instructions, so the `.literal_position' directive is
only needed to specify some other location for a literal pool.  You may
need to add an explicit jump instruction to skip over an inline literal
pool.

   For example, an interrupt vector does not begin with an `ENTRY'
instruction so the assembler will be unable to automatically find a good
place to put a literal pool.  Moreover, the code for the interrupt
vector must be at a specific starting address, so the literal pool
cannot come before the start of the code.  The literal pool for the
vector must be explicitly positioned in the middle of the vector (before
any uses of the literals, due to the negative offsets used by
PC-relative `L32R' instructions).  The `.literal_position' directive
can be used to do this.  In the following code, the literal for `M'
will automatically be aligned correctly and is placed after the
unconditional jump.

         .global M
     code_start:
         j continue
         .literal_position
         .align 4
     continue:
         movi    a4, M


File: as.info,  Node: Literal Prefix Directive,  Next: Absolute Literals Directive,  Prev: Literal Position Directive,  Up: Xtensa Directives

8.34.5.6 literal_prefix
.......................

The `literal_prefix' directive allows you to specify different sections
to hold literals from different portions of an assembly file.  With
this directive, a single assembly file can be used to generate code
into multiple sections, including literals generated by the assembler.

         .begin literal_prefix [NAME]
         .end literal_prefix

   By default the assembler places literal pools in sections separate
from the instructions, using the default literal section names of
`.literal' for PC-relative mode `L32R' instructions and `.lit4' for
absolute mode `L32R' instructions (*note Absolute Literals
Directive::).  The `literal_prefix' directive causes different literal
sections to be used for the code inside the delimited region.  The new
literal sections are determined by including NAME as a prefix to the
default literal section names.  If the NAME argument is omitted, the
literal sections revert to the defaults.  This directive has no effect
when using the `--text-section-literals' option (*note Command Line
Options: Xtensa Options.).

   Except for two special cases, the assembler determines the new
literal sections by simply prepending NAME to the default section names,
resulting in `NAME.literal' and `NAME.lit4' sections.  The
`literal_prefix' directive is often used with the name of the current
text section as the prefix argument.  To facilitate this usage, the
assembler uses special case rules when it recognizes NAME as a text
section name.  First, if NAME ends with `.text', that suffix is not
included in the literal section name.  For example, if NAME is
`.iram0.text', then the literal sections will be `.iram0.literal' and
`.iram0.lit4'.  Second, if NAME begins with `.gnu.linkonce.t.', then
the literal section names are formed by replacing the `.t' substring
with `.literal' and `.lit4'.  For example, if NAME is
`.gnu.linkonce.t.func', the literal sections will be
`.gnu.linkonce.literal.func' and `.gnu.linkonce.lit4.func'.


File: as.info,  Node: Absolute Literals Directive,  Prev: Literal Prefix Directive,  Up: Xtensa Directives

8.34.5.7 absolute-literals
..........................

The `absolute-literals' and `no-absolute-literals' directives control
the absolute vs. PC-relative mode for `L32R' instructions.  These are
relevant only for Xtensa configurations that include the absolute
addressing option for `L32R' instructions.

         .begin [no-]absolute-literals
         .end [no-]absolute-literals

   These directives do not change the `L32R' mode--they only cause the
assembler to emit the appropriate kind of relocation for `L32R'
instructions and to place the literal values in the appropriate section.
To change the `L32R' mode, the program must write the `LITBASE' special
register.  It is the programmer's responsibility to keep track of the
mode and indicate to the assembler which mode is used in each region of
code.

   If the Xtensa configuration includes the absolute `L32R' addressing
option, the default is to assume absolute `L32R' addressing unless the
`--no-absolute-literals' command-line option is specified.  Otherwise,
the default is to assume PC-relative `L32R' addressing.  The
`absolute-literals' directive can then be used to override the default
determined by the command-line options.

9 Reporting Bugs
****************

Your bug reports play an essential role in making `as' reliable.

   Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem,
or it may not.  But in any case the principal function of a bug report
is to help the entire community by making the next version of `as' work
better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of `as'.

   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that enables us to fix the bug.

* Menu:

* Bug Criteria::                Have you found a bug?
* Bug Reporting::               How to report bugs


File: as.info,  Node: Bug Criteria,  Next: Bug Reporting,  Up: Reporting Bugs

9.1 Have You Found a Bug?
=========================

If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If the assembler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that
     is a `as' bug.  Reliable assemblers never crash.

   * If `as' produces an error message for valid input, that is a bug.

   * If `as' does not produce an error message for invalid input, that
     is a bug.  However, you should note that your idea of "invalid
     input" might be our idea of "an extension" or "support for
     traditional practice".

   * If you are an experienced user of assemblers, your suggestions for
     improvement of `as' are welcome in any case.


File: as.info,  Node: Bug Reporting,  Prev: Bug Criteria,  Up: Reporting Bugs

9.2 How to Report Bugs
======================

A number of companies and individuals offer support for GNU products.
If you obtained `as' from a support organization, we recommend you
contact that organization first.

   You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file `etc/SERVICE' in the GNU Emacs distribution.

   In any event, we also recommend that you send bug reports for `as'
to `bug-binutils@@gnu.org'.

   The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
*report all the facts*.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or
leave it out, state it!

   Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of a symbol you use in an example does not matter.
Well, probably it does not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps the bug
is a stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the location
where that name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were
different, the contents of that location would fool the assembler into
doing the right thing despite the bug.  Play it safe and give a
specific, complete example.  That is the easiest thing for you to do,
and the most helpful.

   Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix
the bug if it is new to us.  Therefore, always write your bug reports
on the assumption that the bug has not been reported previously.

   Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
bell?"  This cannot help us fix a bug, so it is basically useless.  We
respond by asking for enough details to enable us to investigate.  You
might as well expedite matters by sending them to begin with.

   To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:

   * The version of `as'.  `as' announces it if you start it with the
     `--version' argument.

     Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in
     looking for the bug in the current version of `as'.

   * Any patches you may have applied to the `as' source.

   * The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name
     and version number.

   * What compiler (and its version) was used to compile `as'--e.g.
     "`gcc-2.7'".

   * The command arguments you gave the assembler to assemble your
     example and observe the bug.  To guarantee you will not omit
     something important, list them all.  A copy of the Makefile (or
     the output from make) is sufficient.

     If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess
     wrong and then we might not encounter the bug.

   * A complete input file that will reproduce the bug.  If the bug is
     observed when the assembler is invoked via a compiler, send the
     assembler source, not the high level language source.  Most
     compilers will produce the assembler source when run with the `-S'
     option.  If you are using `gcc', use the options `-v
     --save-temps'; this will save the assembler source in a file with
     an extension of `.s', and also show you exactly how `as' is being
     run.

   * A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
     incorrect.  For example, "It gets a fatal signal."

     Of course, if the bug is that `as' gets a fatal signal, then we
     will certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we
     might not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You might as well
     not give us a chance to make a mistake.

     Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should
     still say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on,
     such as, your copy of `as' is out of synch, or you have
     encountered a bug in the C library on your system.  (This has
     happened!)  Your copy might crash and ours would not.  If you told
     us to expect a crash, then when ours fails to crash, we would know
     that the bug was not happening for us.  If you had not told us to
     expect a crash, then we would not be able to draw any conclusion
     from our observations.

   * If you wish to suggest changes to the `as' source, send us context
     diffs, as generated by `diff' with the `-u', `-c', or `-p' option.
     Always send diffs from the old file to the new file.  If you even
     discuss something in the `as' source, refer to it by context, not
     by line number.

     The line numbers in our development sources will not match those
     in your sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful
     information to us.

   Here are some things that are not necessary:

   * A description of the envelope of the bug.

     Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
     which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
     changes will not affect it.

     This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way
     we will find the bug is by running a single example under the
     debugger with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of
     examples.  We recommend that you save your time for something else.

     Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report _instead_
     of the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
     output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
     less time, and so on.

     However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do
     this, report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you
     used.

   * A patch for the bug.

     A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not
     omit the necessary information, such as the test case, on the
     assumption that a patch is all we need.  We might see problems
     with your patch and decide to fix the problem another way, or we
     might not understand it at all.

     Sometimes with a program as complicated as `as' it is very hard to
     construct an example that will make the program follow a certain
     path through the code.  If you do not send us the example, we will
     not be able to construct one, so we will not be able to verify
     that the bug is fixed.

     And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why
     your patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A
     test case will help us to understand.

   * A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

     Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about
     such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

*******************

If you have contributed to GAS and your name isn't listed here, it is
not meant as a slight.  We just don't know about it.  Send mail to the
maintainer, and we'll correct the situation.  Currently the maintainer
is Ken Raeburn (email address `raeburn@@cygnus.com').

   Dean Elsner wrote the original GNU assembler for the VAX.(1)

   Jay Fenlason maintained GAS for a while, adding support for
GDB-specific debug information and the 68k series machines, most of the
preprocessing pass, and extensive changes in `messages.c',
`input-file.c', `write.c'.

   K. Richard Pixley maintained GAS for a while, adding various
enhancements and many bug fixes, including merging support for several
processors, breaking GAS up to handle multiple object file format back
ends (including heavy rewrite, testing, an integration of the coff and
b.out back ends), adding configuration including heavy testing and
verification of cross assemblers and file splits and renaming,
converted GAS to strictly ANSI C including full prototypes, added
support for m680[34]0 and cpu32, did considerable work on i960
including a COFF port (including considerable amounts of reverse
engineering), a SPARC opcode file rewrite, DECstation, rs6000, and
hp300hpux host ports, updated "know" assertions and made them work,
much other reorganization, cleanup, and lint.

   Ken Raeburn wrote the high-level BFD interface code to replace most
of the code in format-specific I/O modules.

   The original VMS support was contributed by David L. Kashtan.  Eric
Youngdale has done much work with it since.

   The Intel 80386 machine description was written by Eliot Dresselhaus.

   Minh Tran-Le at IntelliCorp contributed some AIX 386 support.

   The Motorola 88k machine description was contributed by Devon Bowen
of Buffalo University and Torbjorn Granlund of the Swedish Institute of
Computer Science.

   Keith Knowles at the Open Software Foundation wrote the original
MIPS back end (`tc-mips.c', `tc-mips.h'), and contributed Rose format
support (which hasn't been merged in yet).  Ralph Campbell worked with
the MIPS code to support a.out format.

   Support for the Zilog Z8k and Renesas H8/300 processors (tc-z8k,
tc-h8300), and IEEE 695 object file format (obj-ieee), was written by
Steve Chamberlain of Cygnus Support.  Steve also modified the COFF back
end to use BFD for some low-level operations, for use with the H8/300
and AMD 29k targets.

   John Gilmore built the AMD 29000 support, added `.include' support,
and simplified the configuration of which versions accept which
directives.  He updated the 68k machine description so that Motorola's
opcodes always produced fixed-size instructions (e.g., `jsr'), while
synthetic instructions remained shrinkable (`jbsr').  John fixed many
bugs, including true tested cross-compilation support, and one bug in
relaxation that took a week and required the proverbial one-bit fix.

   Ian Lance Taylor of Cygnus Support merged the Motorola and MIT
syntax for the 68k, completed support for some COFF targets (68k, i386
SVR3, and SCO Unix), added support for MIPS ECOFF and ELF targets,
wrote the initial RS/6000 and PowerPC assembler, and made a few other
minor patches.

   Steve Chamberlain made GAS able to generate listings.

   Hewlett-Packard contributed support for the HP9000/300.

   Jeff Law wrote GAS and BFD support for the native HPPA object format
(SOM) along with a fairly extensive HPPA testsuite (for both SOM and
ELF object formats).  This work was supported by both the Center for
Software Science at the University of Utah and Cygnus Support.

   Support for ELF format files has been worked on by Mark Eichin of
Cygnus Support (original, incomplete implementation for SPARC), Pete
Hoogenboom and Jeff Law at the University of Utah (HPPA mainly),
Michael Meissner of the Open Software Foundation (i386 mainly), and Ken
Raeburn of Cygnus Support (sparc, and some initial 64-bit support).

   Linas Vepstas added GAS support for the ESA/390 "IBM 370"
architecture.

   Richard Henderson rewrote the Alpha assembler. Klaus Kaempf wrote
GAS and BFD support for openVMS/Alpha.

   Timothy Wall, Michael Hayes, and Greg Smart contributed to the
various tic* flavors.

   David Heine, Sterling Augustine, Bob Wilson and John Ruttenberg from
Tensilica, Inc. added support for Xtensa processors.

   Several engineers at Cygnus Support have also provided many small
bug fixes and configuration enhancements.

   Many others have contributed large or small bugfixes and
enhancements.  If you have contributed significant work and are not
mentioned on this list, and want to be, let us know.  Some of the
history has been lost; we are not intentionally leaving anyone out.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                        Version 1.1, March 2000

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2003 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
     the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
     modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
     this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
     credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.


  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
     under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to
     any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
     and is addressed as "you."

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
     The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
     the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly
     and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed
     to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
     Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque."

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
     Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
     100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
     must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
     computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
     of the Document, free of added material, which the general
     network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
     distinct    from that of the Document, and from those of previous
     versions    (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
     History section    of the Document).  You may use the same title
     as a previous version    if the original publisher of that version
     gives permission.
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
     entities    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
     Modified    Version, together with at least five of the principal
     authors of the    Document (all of its principal authors, if it
     has less than five).
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
     Modified Version, as the publisher.
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
     adjacent to the other copyright notices.
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
     notice    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
     under the    terms of this License, in the form shown in the
     Addendum below.
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
     Sections    and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
     license notice.
     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add
     to    it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
     If    there is no section entitled "History" in the Document,
     create one    stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of
     the Document as    given on its Title Page, then add an item
     describing the Modified    Version as stated in the previous
     sentence.
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
     likewise    the network locations given in the Document for
     previous versions    it was based on.  These may be placed in the
     "History" section.     You may omit a network location for a work
     that was published at    least four years before the Document
     itself, or if the original    publisher of the version it refers
     to gives permission.
     K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
     preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
      substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
     and/or dedications given therein.
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
     unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
     or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
     M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements."  Such a section
     may not be included in the Modified Version.
     N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"    or to
     conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition
     of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications."  You
     must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
     called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
     derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
     aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License provided that you also include the
     original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English
     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

     Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
     Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
     under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
     or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
     with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
     Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
     A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
     Free Documentation License."

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover
Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being
LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.

8.12.8 Floating Point
---------------------

All 80387 floating point types except packed BCD are supported.  (BCD
support may be added without much difficulty).  These data types are
16-, 32-, and 64- bit integers, and single (32-bit), double (64-bit),
and extended (80-bit) precision floating point.  Each supported type
has an instruction mnemonic suffix and a constructor associated with
it.  Instruction mnemonic suffixes specify the operand's data type.
Constructors build these data types into memory.

   * Floating point constructors are `.float' or `.single', `.double',
     and `.tfloat' for 32-, 64-, and 80-bit formats.  These correspond
     to instruction mnemonic suffixes `s', `l', and `t'. `t' stands for
     80-bit (ten byte) real.  The 80387 only supports this format via
     the `fldt' (load 80-bit real to stack top) and `fstpt' (store
     80-bit real and pop stack) instructions.

   * Integer constructors are `.word', `.long' or `.int', and `.quad'
     for the 16-, 32-, and 64-bit integer formats.  The corresponding
     instruction mnemonic suffixes are `s' (single), `l' (long), and
     `q' (quad).  As with the 80-bit real format, the 64-bit `q' format
     is only present in the `fildq' (load quad integer to stack top)
     and `fistpq' (store quad integer and pop stack) instructions.

   Register to register operations should not use instruction mnemonic
suffixes.  `fstl %st, %st(1)' will give a warning, and be assembled as
if you wrote `fst %st, %st(1)', since all register to register
operations use 80-bit floating point operands. (Contrast this with
`fstl %st, mem', which converts `%st' from 80-bit to 64-bit floating
point format, then stores the result in the 4 byte location `mem')

8.12.9 Intel's MMX and AMD's 3DNow! SIMD Operations
---------------------------------------------------

`as' supports Intel's MMX instruction set (SIMD instructions for
integer data), available on Intel's Pentium MMX processors and Pentium
II processors, AMD's K6 and K6-2 processors, Cyrix' M2 processor, and
probably others.  It also supports AMD's 3DNow!  instruction set (SIMD
instructions for 32-bit floating point data) available on AMD's K6-2
processor and possibly others in the future.

   Currently, `as' does not support Intel's floating point SIMD, Katmai
(KNI).

   The eight 64-bit MMX operands, also used by 3DNow!, are called
`%mm0', `%mm1', ... `%mm7'.  They contain eight 8-bit integers, four
16-bit integers, two 32-bit integers, one 64-bit integer, or two 32-bit
floating point values.  The MMX registers cannot be used at the same
time as the floating point stack.

   See Intel and AMD documentation, keeping in mind that the operand
order in instructions is reversed from the Intel syntax.

8.12.10 Writing 16-bit Code
---------------------------

While `as' normally writes only "pure" 32-bit i386 code or 64-bit
x86-64 code depending on the default configuration, it also supports
writing code to run in real mode or in 16-bit protected mode code
segments.  To do this, put a `.code16' or `.code16gcc' directive before
the assembly language instructions to be run in 16-bit mode.  You can
switch `as' back to writing normal 32-bit code with the `.code32'
directive.

   `.code16gcc' provides experimental support for generating 16-bit
code from gcc, and differs from `.code16' in that `call', `ret',
`enter', `leave', `push', `pop', `pusha', `popa', `pushf', and `popf'
instructions default to 32-bit size.  This is so that the stack pointer
is manipulated in the same way over function calls, allowing access to
function parameters at the same stack offsets as in 32-bit mode.
`.code16gcc' also automatically adds address size prefixes where
necessary to use the 32-bit addressing modes that gcc generates.

   The code which `as' generates in 16-bit mode will not necessarily
run on a 16-bit pre-80386 processor.  To write code that runs on such a
processor, you must refrain from using _any_ 32-bit constructs which
require `as' to output address or operand size prefixes.

   Note that writing 16-bit code instructions by explicitly specifying a
prefix or an instruction mnemonic suffix within a 32-bit code section
generates different machine instructions than those generated for a
16-bit code segment.  In a 32-bit code section, the following code
generates the machine opcode bytes `66 6a 04', which pushes the value
`4' onto the stack, decrementing `%esp' by 2.

             pushw $4

   The same code in a 16-bit code section would generate the machine
opcode bytes `6a 04' (ie. without the operand size prefix), which is
correct since the processor default operand size is assumed to be 16
bits in a 16-bit code section.

8.12.11 AT&T Syntax bugs
------------------------

The UnixWare assembler, and probably other AT&T derived ix86 Unix
assemblers, generate floating point instructions with reversed source
and destination registers in certain cases.  Unfortunately, gcc and
possibly many other programs use this reversed syntax, so we're stuck
with it.

   For example

             fsub %st,%st(3)
   results in `%st(3)' being updated to `%st - %st(3)' rather than the
expected `%st(3) - %st'.  This happens with all the non-commutative
arithmetic floating point operations with two register operands where
the source register is `%st' and the destination register is `%st(i)'.

8.12.12 Specifying CPU Architecture
-----------------------------------

`as' may be told to assemble for a particular CPU (sub-)architecture
with the `.arch CPU_TYPE' directive.  This directive enables a warning
when gas detects an instruction that is not supported on the CPU
specified.  The choices for CPU_TYPE are:

`i8086'        `i186'         `i286'         `i386'
`i486'         `i586'         `i686'         `pentium'
`pentiumpro'   `pentiumii'    `pentiumiii'   `pentium4'
`k6'           `athlon'                      
               `sledgehammer'                
`.mmx' `.sse'                                
`.sse2'                                      
`.3dnow'                                     

   Apart from the warning, there are only two other effects on `as'
operation;  Firstly, if you specify a CPU other than `i486', then shift
by one instructions such as `sarl $1, %eax' will automatically use a
two byte opcode sequence.  The larger three byte opcode sequence is
used on the 486 (and when no architecture is specified) because it
executes faster on the 486.  Note that you can explicitly request the
two byte opcode by writing `sarl %eax'.  Secondly, if you specify
`i8086', `i186', or `i286', _and_ `.code16' or `.code16gcc' then byte
offset conditional jumps will be promoted when necessary to a two
instruction sequence consisting of a conditional jump of the opposite
sense around an unconditional jump to the target.

   Following the CPU architecture (but not a sub-architecture, which
are those starting with a dot), you may specify `jumps' or `nojumps' to
control automatic promotion of conditional jumps. `jumps' is the
default, and enables jump promotion;  All external jumps will be of the
long variety, and file-local jumps will be promoted as necessary.
(*note i386-Jumps::)  `nojumps' leaves external conditional jumps as
byte offset jumps, and warns about file-local conditional jumps that
`as' promotes.  Unconditional jumps are treated as for `jumps'.

   For example

      .arch i8086,nojumps

8.12.13 Notes
-------------

There is some trickery concerning the `mul' and `imul' instructions
that deserves mention.  The 16-, 32-, 64- and 128-bit expanding
multiplies (base opcode `0xf6'; extension 4 for `mul' and 5 for `imul')
can be output only in the one operand form.  Thus, `imul %ebx, %eax'
does _not_ select the expanding multiply; the expanding multiply would
clobber the `%edx' register, and this would confuse `gcc' output.  Use
`imul %ebx' to get the 64-bit product in `%edx:%eax'.

   We have added a two operand form of `imul' when the first operand is
an immediate mode expression and the second operand is a register.
This is just a shorthand, so that, multiplying `%eax' by 69, for
example, can be done with `imul $69, %eax' rather than `imul $69, %eax,
%eax'.

8.13.1 i860 Notes
-----------------

This is a fairly complete i860 assembler which is compatible with the
UNIX System V/860 Release 4 assembler. However, it does not currently
support SVR4 PIC (i.e., `@@GOT, @@GOTOFF, @@PLT').

   Like the SVR4/860 assembler, the output object format is ELF32.
Currently, this is the only supported object format. If there is
sufficient interest, other formats such as COFF may be implemented.

   Both the Intel and AT&T/SVR4 syntaxes are supported, with the latter
being the default.  One difference is that AT&T syntax requires the '%'
prefix on register names while Intel syntax does not.  Another
difference is in the specification of relocatable expressions.  The
Intel syntax is `ha%expression' whereas the SVR4 syntax is
`[expression]@@ha' (and similarly for the "l" and "h" selectors).

8.13.2 i860 Command-line Options
--------------------------------

8.13.2.1 SVR4 compatibility options
...................................

`-V'
     Print assembler version.

`-Qy'
     Ignored.

`-Qn'
     Ignored.

8.13.2.2 Other options
......................

`-EL'
     Select little endian output (this is the default).

`-EB'
     Select big endian output. Note that the i860 always reads
     instructions as little endian data, so this option only effects
     data and not instructions.

`-mwarn-expand'
     Emit a warning message if any pseudo-instruction expansions
     occurred.  For example, a `or' instruction with an immediate
     larger than 16-bits will be expanded into two instructions. This
     is a very undesirable feature to rely on, so this flag can help
     detect any code where it happens. One use of it, for instance, has
     been to find and eliminate any place where `gcc' may emit these
     pseudo-instructions.

`-mxp'
     Enable support for the i860XP instructions and control registers.
     By default, this option is disabled so that only the base
     instruction set (i.e., i860XR) is supported.

`-mintel-syntax'
     The i860 assembler defaults to AT&T/SVR4 syntax.  This option
     enables the Intel syntax.

8.13.3 i860 Machine Directives
------------------------------

`.dual'
     Enter dual instruction mode. While this directive is supported, the
     preferred way to use dual instruction mode is to explicitly code
     the dual bit with the `d.' prefix.

`.enddual'
     Exit dual instruction mode. While this directive is supported, the
     preferred way to use dual instruction mode is to explicitly code
     the dual bit with the `d.' prefix.

`.atmp'
     Change the temporary register used when expanding pseudo
     operations. The default register is `r31'.

   The `.dual', `.enddual', and `.atmp' directives are available only
in the Intel syntax mode.

   Both syntaxes allow for the standard `.align' directive.  However,
the Intel syntax additionally allows keywords for the alignment
parameter: "`.align type'", where `type' is one of `.short', `.long',
`.quad', `.single', `.double' representing alignments of 2, 4, 16, 4,
and 8, respectively.

-------------------

All of the Intel i860XR and i860XP machine instructions are supported.
Please see either _i860 Microprocessor Programmer's Reference Manual_
or _i860 Microprocessor Architecture_ for more information.

8.13.4.1 Other instruction support (pseudo-instructions)
........................................................

For compatibility with some other i860 assemblers, a number of
pseudo-instructions are supported. While these are supported, they are
a very undesirable feature that should be avoided - in particular, when
they result in an expansion to multiple actual i860 instructions. Below
are the pseudo-instructions that result in expansions.
   * Load large immediate into general register:

     The pseudo-instruction `mov imm,%rn' (where the immediate does not
     fit within a signed 16-bit field) will be expanded into:
          orh large_imm@@h,%r0,%rn
          or large_imm@@l,%rn,%rn

   * Load/store with relocatable address expression:

     For example, the pseudo-instruction `ld.b addr_exp(%rx),%rn' will
     be expanded into:
          orh addr_exp@@ha,%rx,%r31
          ld.l addr_exp@@l(%r31),%rn

     The analogous expansions apply to `ld.x, st.x, fld.x, pfld.x,
     fst.x', and `pst.x' as well.

   * Signed large immediate with add/subtract:

     If any of the arithmetic operations `adds, addu, subs, subu' are
     used with an immediate larger than 16-bits (signed), then they
     will be expanded.  For instance, the pseudo-instruction `adds
     large_imm,%rx,%rn' expands to:
          orh large_imm@@h,%r0,%r31
          or large_imm@@l,%r31,%r31
          adds %r31,%rx,%rn

   * Unsigned large immediate with logical operations:

     Logical operations (`or, andnot, or, xor') also result in
     expansions.  The pseudo-instruction `or large_imm,%rx,%rn' results
     in:
          orh large_imm@@h,%rx,%r31
          or large_imm@@l,%r31,%rn

     Similarly for the others, except for `and' which expands to:
          andnot (-1 - large_imm)@@h,%rx,%r31
          andnot (-1 - large_imm)@@l,%r31,%rn

File: as.info,  Node: Options-i960,  Next: Floating Point-i960,  Up: i960-Dependent

8.14.1 i960 Command-line Options
--------------------------------

`-ACA | -ACA_A | -ACB | -ACC | -AKA | -AKB | -AKC | -AMC'
     Select the 80960 architecture.  Instructions or features not
     supported by the selected architecture cause fatal errors.

     `-ACA' is equivalent to `-ACA_A'; `-AKC' is equivalent to `-AMC'.
     Synonyms are provided for compatibility with other tools.

     If you do not specify any of these options, `as' generates code
     for any instruction or feature that is supported by _some_ version
     of the 960 (even if this means mixing architectures!).  In
     principle, `as' attempts to deduce the minimal sufficient
     processor type if none is specified; depending on the object code
     format, the processor type may be recorded in the object file.  If
     it is critical that the `as' output match a specific architecture,
     specify that architecture explicitly.

`-b'
     Add code to collect information about conditional branches taken,
     for later optimization using branch prediction bits.  (The
     conditional branch instructions have branch prediction bits in the
     CA, CB, and CC architectures.)  If BR represents a conditional
     branch instruction, the following represents the code generated by
     the assembler when `-b' is specified:

                  call    INCREMENT ROUTINE
                  .word   0       # pre-counter
          Label:  BR
                  call    INCREMENT ROUTINE
                  .word   0       # post-counter

     The counter following a branch records the number of times that
     branch was _not_ taken; the differenc between the two counters is
     the number of times the branch _was_ taken.

     A table of every such `Label' is also generated, so that the
     external postprocessor `gbr960' (supplied by Intel) can locate all
     the counters.  This table is always labeled `__BRANCH_TABLE__';
     this is a local symbol to permit collecting statistics for many
     separate object files.  The table is word aligned, and begins with
     a two-word header.  The first word, initialized to 0, is used in
     maintaining linked lists of branch tables.  The second word is a
     count of the number of entries in the table, which follow
     immediately: each is a word, pointing to one of the labels
     illustrated above.

           +------------+------------+------------+ ... +------------+
           |            |            |            |     |            |
           |  *NEXT     |  COUNT: N  | *BRLAB 1   |     | *BRLAB N   |
           |            |            |            |     |            |
           +------------+------------+------------+ ... +------------+

                         __BRANCH_TABLE__ layout

     The first word of the header is used to locate multiple branch
     tables, since each object file may contain one. Normally the links
     are maintained with a call to an initialization routine, placed at
     the beginning of each function in the file.  The GNU C compiler
     generates these calls automatically when you give it a `-b' option.
     For further details, see the documentation of `gbr960'.

`-no-relax'
     Normally, Compare-and-Branch instructions with targets that require
     displacements greater than 13 bits (or that have external targets)
     are replaced with the corresponding compare (or `chkbit') and
     branch instructions.  You can use the `-no-relax' option to
     specify that `as' should generate errors instead, if the target
     displacement is larger than 13 bits.

     This option does not affect the Compare-and-Jump instructions; the
     code emitted for them is _always_ adjusted when necessary
     (depending on displacement size), regardless of whether you use
     `-no-relax'.

8.14.3 i960 Machine Directives
------------------------------

`.bss SYMBOL, LENGTH, ALIGN'
     Reserve LENGTH bytes in the bss section for a local SYMBOL,
     aligned to the power of two specified by ALIGN.  LENGTH and ALIGN
     must be positive absolute expressions.  This directive differs
     from `.lcomm' only in that it permits you to specify an alignment.
     *Note `.lcomm': Lcomm.

`.extended FLONUMS'
     `.extended' expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas; for
     each flonum, `.extended' emits an IEEE extended-format (80-bit)
     floating-point number.

`.leafproc CALL-LAB, BAL-LAB'
     You can use the `.leafproc' directive in conjunction with the
     optimized `callj' instruction to enable faster calls of leaf
     procedures.  If a procedure is known to call no other procedures,
     you may define an entry point that skips procedure prolog code
     (and that does not depend on system-supplied saved context), and
     declare it as the BAL-LAB using `.leafproc'.  If the procedure
     also has an entry point that goes through the normal prolog, you
     can specify that entry point as CALL-LAB.

     A `.leafproc' declaration is meant for use in conjunction with the
     optimized call instruction `callj'; the directive records the data
     needed later to choose between converting the `callj' into a `bal'
     or a `call'.

     CALL-LAB is optional; if only one argument is present, or if the
     two arguments are identical, the single argument is assumed to be
     the `bal' entry point.

`.sysproc NAME, INDEX'
     The `.sysproc' directive defines a name for a system procedure.
     After you define it using `.sysproc', you can use NAME to refer to
     the system procedure identified by INDEX when calling procedures
     with the optimized call instruction `callj'.

     Both arguments are required; INDEX must be between 0 and 31
     (inclusive).

8.14.4.1 `callj'
................

You can write `callj' to have the assembler or the linker determine the
most appropriate form of subroutine call: `call', `bal', or `calls'.
If the assembly source contains enough information--a `.leafproc' or
`.sysproc' directive defining the operand--then `as' translates the
`callj'; if not, it simply emits the `callj', leaving it for the linker
to resolve.

8.14.4.2 Compare-and-Branch
...........................

The 960 architectures provide combined Compare-and-Branch instructions
that permit you to store the branch target in the lower 13 bits of the
instruction word itself.  However, if you specify a branch target far
enough away that its address won't fit in 13 bits, the assembler can
either issue an error, or convert your Compare-and-Branch instruction
into separate instructions to do the compare and the branch.

   Whether `as' gives an error or expands the instruction depends on
two choices you can make: whether you use the `-no-relax' option, and
whether you use a "Compare and Branch" instruction or a "Compare and
Jump" instruction.  The "Jump" instructions are _always_ expanded if
necessary; the "Branch" instructions are expanded when necessary
_unless_ you specify `-no-relax'--in which case `as' gives an error
instead.

   These are the Compare-and-Branch instructions, their "Jump" variants,
and the instruction pairs they may expand into:

             Compare and
          Branch      Jump       Expanded to

8.15.1 Options
--------------

`-mconstant-gp'
     This option instructs the assembler to mark the resulting object
     file as using the "constant GP" model.  With this model, it is
     assumed that the entire program uses a single global pointer (GP)
     value.  Note that this option does not in any fashion affect the
     machine code emitted by the assembler.  All it does is turn on the
     EF_IA_64_CONS_GP flag in the ELF file header.

`-mauto-pic'
     This option instructs the assembler to mark the resulting object
     file as using the "constant GP without function descriptor" data
     model.  This model is like the "constant GP" model, except that it
     additionally does away with function descriptors.  What this means
     is that the address of a function refers directly to the
     function's code entry-point.  Normally, such an address would
     refer to a function descriptor, which contains both the code
     entry-point and the GP-value needed by the function.  Note that
     this option does not in any fashion affect the machine code
     emitted by the assembler.  All it does is turn on the
     EF_IA_64_NOFUNCDESC_CONS_GP flag in the ELF file header.

`-milp32'

`-milp64'

`-mlp64'

`-mp64'
     These options select the data model.  The assembler defaults to
     `-mlp64' (LP64 data model).

`-mle'

`-mbe'
     These options select the byte order.  The `-mle' option selects
     little-endian byte order (default) and `-mbe' selects big-endian
     byte order.  Note that IA-64 machine code always uses
     little-endian byte order.

`-munwind-check=warning'

`-munwind-check=error'
     These options control what the assembler will do when performing
     consistency checks on unwind directives.  `-munwind-check=warning'
     will make the assembler issue a warning when an unwind directive
     check fails.  This is the default.  `-munwind-check=error' will
     make the assembler issue an error when an unwind directive check
     fails.

`-mhint.b=ok'

`-mhint.b=warning'

`-mhint.b=error'
     These options control what the assembler will do when the `hint.b'
     instruction is used.  `-mhint.b=ok' will make the assembler accept
     `hint.b'.  `-mint.b=warning' will make the assembler issue a
     warning when `hint.b' is used.  `-mhint.b=error' will make the
     assembler treat `hint.b' as an error, which is the default.

`-x'

`-xexplicit'
     These options turn on dependency violation checking.

`-xauto'
     This option instructs the assembler to automatically insert stop
     bits where necessary to remove dependency violations.  This is the
     default mode.

`-xnone'
     This option turns off dependency violation checking.

`-xdebug'
     This turns on debug output intended to help tracking down bugs in
     the dependency violation checker.

`-xdebugn'
     This is a shortcut for -xnone -xdebug.

`-xdebugx'
     This is a shortcut for -xexplicit -xdebug.

8.17.1 M32R Options
-------------------

The Renease M32R version of `as' has a few machine dependent options:

`-m32rx'
     `as' can assemble code for several different members of the
     Renesas M32R family.  Normally the default is to assemble code for
     the M32R microprocessor.  This option may be used to change the
     default to the M32RX microprocessor, which adds some more
     instructions to the basic M32R instruction set, and some
     additional parameters to some of the original instructions.

`-m32r2'
     This option changes the target processor to the the M32R2
     microprocessor.

`-m32r'
     This option can be used to restore the assembler's default
     behaviour of assembling for the M32R microprocessor.  This can be
     useful if the default has been changed by a previous command line
     option.

`-little'
     This option tells the assembler to produce little-endian code and
     data.  The default is dependent upon how the toolchain was
     configured.

`-EL'
     This is a synonum for _-little_.

`-big'
     This option tells the assembler to produce big-endian code and
     data.

`-EB'
     This is a synonum for _-big_.

`-KPIC'
     This option specifies that the output of the assembler should be
     marked as position-independent code (PIC).

`-parallel'
     This option tells the assembler to attempts to combine two
     sequential instructions into a single, parallel instruction, where
     it is legal to do so.

`-no-parallel'
     This option disables a previously enabled _-parallel_ option.

`-no-bitinst'
     This option disables the support for the extended bit-field
     instructions provided by the M32R2.  If this support needs to be
     re-enabled the _-bitinst_ switch can be used to restore it.

`-O'
     This option tells the assembler to attempt to optimize the
     instructions that it produces.  This includes filling delay slots
     and converting sequential instructions into parallel ones.  This
     option implies _-parallel_.

`-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts'
     Instructs `as' to produce warning messages when questionable
     parallel instructions are encountered.  This option is enabled by
     default, but `gcc' disables it when it invokes `as' directly.
     Questionable instructions are those whoes behaviour would be
     different if they were executed sequentially.  For example the
     code fragment `mv r1, r2 || mv r3, r1' produces a different result
     from `mv r1, r2 \n mv r3, r1' since the former moves r1 into r3
     and then r2 into r1, whereas the later moves r2 into r1 and r3.

`-Wp'
     This is a shorter synonym for the
     _-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts_ option.

`-no-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts'
     Instructs `as' not to produce warning messages when questionable
     parallel instructions are encountered.

`-Wnp'
     This is a shorter synonym for the
     _-no-warn-explicit-parallel-conflicts_ option.

`-ignore-parallel-conflicts'
     This option tells the assembler's to stop checking parallel
     instructions for contraint violations.  This ability is provided
     for hardware vendors testing chip designs and should not be used
     under normal circumstances.

`-no-ignore-parallel-conflicts'
     This option restores the assembler's default behaviour of checking
     parallel instructions to detect constraint violations.

`-Ip'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-ignore-parallel-conflicts_
     option.

`-nIp'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-no-ignore-parallel-conflicts_
     option.

`-warn-unmatched-high'
     This option tells the assembler to produce a warning message if a
     `.high' pseudo op is encountered without a mathcing `.low' pseudo
     op.  The presence of such an unmatches pseudo op usually indicates
     a programming error.

`-no-warn-unmatched-high'
     Disables a previously enabled _-warn-unmatched-high_ option.

`-Wuh'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-warn-unmatched-high_ option.

`-Wnuh'
     This is a shorter synonym for the _-no-warn-unmatched-high_ option.

8.17.2 M32R Directives
----------------------

The Renease M32R version of `as' has a few architecture specific
directives:

`low EXPRESSION'
     The `low' directive computes the value of its expression and
     places the lower 16-bits of the result into the immediate-field of
     the instruction.  For example:

             or3   r0, r0, #low(0x12345678) ; compute r0 = r0 | 0x5678
             add3, r0, r0, #low(fred)   ; compute r0 = r0 + low 16-bits of address of fred

`high EXPRESSION'
     The `high' directive computes the value of its expression and
     places the upper 16-bits of the result into the immediate-field of
     the instruction.  For example:

             seth  r0, #high(0x12345678) ; compute r0 = 0x12340000
             seth, r0, #high(fred)       ; compute r0 = upper 16-bits of address of fred

`shigh EXPRESSION'
     The `shigh' directive is very similar to the `high' directive.  It
     also computes the value of its expression and places the upper
     16-bits of the result into the immediate-field of the instruction.
     The difference is that `shigh' also checks to see if the lower
     16-bits could be interpreted as a signed number, and if so it
     assumes that a borrow will occur from the upper-16 bits.  To
     compensate for this the `shigh' directive pre-biases the upper 16
     bit value by adding one to it.  For example:

     For example:

             seth  r0, #shigh(0x12345678) ; compute r0 = 0x12340000
             seth  r0, #shigh(0x00008000) ; compute r0 = 0x00010000

     In the second example the lower 16-bits are 0x8000.  If these are
     treated as a signed value and sign extended to 32-bits then the
     value becomes 0xffff8000.  If this value is then added to
     0x00010000 then the result is 0x00008000.

     This behaviour is to allow for the different semantics of the
     `or3' and `add3' instructions.  The `or3' instruction treats its
     16-bit immediate argument as unsigned whereas the `add3' treats
     its 16-bit immediate as a signed value.  So for example:

             seth  r0, #shigh(0x00008000)
             add3  r0, r0, #low(0x00008000)

     Produces the correct result in r0, whereas:

             seth  r0, #shigh(0x00008000)
             or3   r0, r0, #low(0x00008000)

     Stores 0xffff8000 into r0.

     Note - the `shigh' directive does not know where in the assembly
     source code the lower 16-bits of the value are going set, so it
     cannot check to make sure that an `or3' instruction is being used
     rather than an `add3' instruction.  It is up to the programmer to
     make sure that correct directives are used.

`.m32r'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-m32r_ command line
     option.  It tells the assembler to only accept M32R instructions
     from now on.  An instructions from later M32R architectures are
     refused.

`.m32rx'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-m32rx_ command
     line option.  It tells the assembler to start accepting the extra
     instructions in the M32RX ISA as well as the ordinary M32R ISA.

`.m32r2'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-m32r2_ command
     line option.  It tells the assembler to start accepting the extra
     instructions in the M32R2 ISA as well as the ordinary M32R ISA.

`.little'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-little_ command
     line option.  It tells the assembler to start producing
     little-endian code and data.  This option should be used with care
     as producing mixed-endian binary files is frought with danger.

`.big'
     The directive performs a similar thing as the _-big_ command line
     option.  It tells the assembler to start producing big-endian code
     and data.  This option should be used with care as producing
     mixed-endian binary files is frought with danger.

8.17.3 M32R Warnings
--------------------

There are several warning and error messages that can be produced by
`as' which are specific to the M32R:

`output of 1st instruction is the same as an input to 2nd instruction - is this intentional ?'
     This message is only produced if warnings for explicit parallel
     conflicts have been enabled.  It indicates that the assembler has
     encountered a parallel instruction in which the destination
     register of the left hand instruction is used as an input register
     in the right hand instruction.  For example in this code fragment
     `mv r1, r2 || neg r3, r1' register r1 is the destination of the
     move instruction and the input to the neg instruction.

`output of 2nd instruction is the same as an input to 1st instruction - is this intentional ?'
     This message is only produced if warnings for explicit parallel
     conflicts have been enabled.  It indicates that the assembler has
     encountered a parallel instruction in which the destination
     register of the right hand instruction is used as an input
     register in the left hand instruction.  For example in this code
     fragment `mv r1, r2 || neg r2, r3' register r2 is the destination
     of the neg instruction and the input to the move instruction.

`instruction `...' is for the M32RX only'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters an
     instruction which is only supported by the M32Rx processor, and
     the `-m32rx' command line flag has not been specified to allow
     assembly of such instructions.

`unknown instruction `...''
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters an
     instruction which it does not recognise.

`only the NOP instruction can be issued in parallel on the m32r'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction which does not involve a NOP instruction and the
     `-m32rx' command line flag has not been specified.  Only the M32Rx
     processor is able to execute two instructions in parallel.

`instruction `...' cannot be executed in parallel.'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction which is made up of one or two instructions which
     cannot be executed in parallel.

`Instructions share the same execution pipeline'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction whoes components both use the same execution pipeline.

`Instructions write to the same destination register.'
     This message is produced when the assembler encounters a parallel
     instruction where both components attempt to modify the same
     register.  For example these code fragments will produce this
     message: `mv r1, r2 || neg r1, r3' `jl r0 || mv r14, r1' `st r2,
     @@-r1 || mv r1, r3' `mv r1, r2 || ld r0, @@r1+' `cmp r1, r2 || addx
     r3, r4' (Both write to the condition bit)

8.18.1 M680x0 Options
---------------------

The Motorola 680x0 version of `as' has a few machine dependent options:

`-l'
     You can use the `-l' option to shorten the size of references to
     undefined symbols.  If you do not use the `-l' option, references
     to undefined symbols are wide enough for a full `long' (32 bits).
     (Since `as' cannot know where these symbols end up, `as' can only
     allocate space for the linker to fill in later.  Since `as' does
     not know how far away these symbols are, it allocates as much
     space as it can.)  If you use this option, the references are only
     one word wide (16 bits).  This may be useful if you want the
     object file to be as small as possible, and you know that the
     relevant symbols are always less than 17 bits away.

`--register-prefix-optional'
     For some configurations, especially those where the compiler
     normally does not prepend an underscore to the names of user
     variables, the assembler requires a `%' before any use of a
     register name.  This is intended to let the assembler distinguish
     between C variables and functions named `a0' through `a7', and so
     on.  The `%' is always accepted, but is not required for certain
     configurations, notably `sun3'.  The `--register-prefix-optional'
     option may be used to permit omitting the `%' even for
     configurations for which it is normally required.  If this is
     done, it will generally be impossible to refer to C variables and
     functions with the same names as register names.

`--bitwise-or'
     Normally the character `|' is treated as a comment character, which
     means that it can not be used in expressions.  The `--bitwise-or'
     option turns `|' into a normal character.  In this mode, you must
     either use C style comments, or start comments with a `#' character
     at the beginning of a line.

`--base-size-default-16  --base-size-default-32'
     If you use an addressing mode with a base register without
     specifying the size, `as' will normally use the full 32 bit value.
     For example, the addressing mode `%a0@@(%d0)' is equivalent to
     `%a0@@(%d0:l)'.  You may use the `--base-size-default-16' option to
     tell `as' to default to using the 16 bit value.  In this case,
     `%a0@@(%d0)' is equivalent to `%a0@@(%d0:w)'.  You may use the
     `--base-size-default-32' option to restore the default behaviour.

`--disp-size-default-16  --disp-size-default-32'
     If you use an addressing mode with a displacement, and the value
     of the displacement is not known, `as' will normally assume that
     the value is 32 bits.  For example, if the symbol `disp' has not
     been defined, `as' will assemble the addressing mode
     `%a0@@(disp,%d0)' as though `disp' is a 32 bit value.  You may use
     the `--disp-size-default-16' option to tell `as' to instead assume
     that the displacement is 16 bits.  In this case, `as' will
     assemble `%a0@@(disp,%d0)' as though `disp' is a 16 bit value.  You
     may use the `--disp-size-default-32' option to restore the default
     behaviour.

`--pcrel'
     Always keep branches PC-relative.  In the M680x0 architecture all
     branches are defined as PC-relative.  However, on some processors
     they are limited to word displacements maximum.  When `as' needs a
     long branch that is not available, it normally emits an absolute
     jump instead.  This option disables this substitution.  When this
     option is given and no long branches are available, only word
     branches will be emitted.  An error message will be generated if a
     word branch cannot reach its target.  This option has no effect on
     68020 and other processors that have long branches.  *note Branch
     Improvement: M68K-Branch.

`-m68000'
     `as' can assemble code for several different members of the
     Motorola 680x0 family.  The default depends upon how `as' was
     configured when it was built; normally, the default is to assemble
     code for the 68020 microprocessor.  The following options may be
     used to change the default.  These options control which
     instructions and addressing modes are permitted.  The members of
     the 680x0 family are very similar.  For detailed information about
     the differences, see the Motorola manuals.

          68060 always support floating point instructions.

    `-mno-68881'
          Do not assemble 68881 floating point instructions.  This is
          the default for 68000 and the 68010.  The 68040 and 68060
          always support floating point instructions, even if this
          option is used.

    `-m68851'
          Assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default for the
          68020, 68030, and 68060.  The 68040 accepts a somewhat
          different set of MMU instructions; `-m68851' and `-m68040'
          should not be used together.

    `-mno-68851'
          Do not assemble 68851 MMU instructions.  This is the default
          for the 68000, 68010, and the CPU32.  The 68040 accepts a
          somewhat different set of MMU instructions.

8.18.2 Syntax
-------------

This syntax for the Motorola 680x0 was developed at MIT.

   The 680x0 version of `as' uses instructions names and syntax
compatible with the Sun assembler.  Intervening periods are ignored;
for example, `movl' is equivalent to `mov.l'.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
(`%a0' through `%a7'), the program counter (`%pc'), the zero-address
relative to the program counter (`%zpc'), a suppressed address register
(`%za0' through `%za7'), or it may be omitted entirely.  The use of
SIZE means one of `w' or `l', and it may be omitted, along with the
leading colon, unless a scale is also specified.  The use of SCALE
means one of `1', `2', `4', or `8', and it may always be omitted along
with the leading colon.

   The following addressing modes are understood:
"Immediate"
     `#NUMBER'

"Data Register"
     `%d0' through `%d7'

"Address Register"
     `%a0' through `%a7'
     `%a7' is also known as `%sp', i.e. the Stack Pointer.  `%a6' is
     also known as `%fp', the Frame Pointer.

"Address Register Indirect"
     `%a0@@' through `%a7@@'

"Address Register Postincrement"
     `%a0@@+' through `%a7@@+'

"Address Register Predecrement"
     `%a0@@-' through `%a7@@-'

"Indirect Plus Offset"
     `APC@@(NUMBER)'

"Index"
     `APC@@(NUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted.

"Postindex"
     `APC@@(NUMBER)@@(ONUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)'

     The ONUMBER or the REGISTER, but not both, may be omitted.

"Preindex"
     `APC@@(NUMBER,REGISTER:SIZE:SCALE)@@(ONUMBER)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted.  Omitting the REGISTER produces the
     Postindex addressing mode.

"Absolute"
     `SYMBOL', or `DIGITS', optionally followed by `:b', `:w', or `:l'.

8.18.3 Motorola Syntax
----------------------

The standard Motorola syntax for this chip differs from the syntax
already discussed (*note Syntax: M68K-Syntax.).  `as' can accept
Motorola syntax for operands, even if MIT syntax is used for other
operands in the same instruction.  The two kinds of syntax are fully
compatible.

   In the following table APC stands for any of the address registers
(`%a0' through `%a7'), the program counter (`%pc'), the zero-address
relative to the program counter (`%zpc'), or a suppressed address
register (`%za0' through `%za7').  The use of SIZE means one of `w' or
`l', and it may always be omitted along with the leading dot.  The use
of SCALE means one of `1', `2', `4', or `8', and it may always be
omitted along with the leading asterisk.

   The following additional addressing modes are understood:

"Address Register Indirect"
     `(%a0)' through `(%a7)'
     `%a7' is also known as `%sp', i.e. the Stack Pointer.  `%a6' is
     also known as `%fp', the Frame Pointer.

"Address Register Postincrement"
     `(%a0)+' through `(%a7)+'

"Address Register Predecrement"
     `-(%a0)' through `-(%a7)'

"Indirect Plus Offset"
     `NUMBER(%A0)' through `NUMBER(%A7)', or `NUMBER(%PC)'.

     The NUMBER may also appear within the parentheses, as in
     `(NUMBER,%A0)'.  When used with the PC, the NUMBER may be omitted
     (with an address register, omitting the NUMBER produces Address
     Register Indirect mode).

"Index"
     `NUMBER(APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE)'

     The NUMBER may be omitted, or it may appear within the
     parentheses.  The APC may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC
     may appear in either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address
     registers, and the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first
     register is taken as the base register, and the second as the
     index register.

"Postindex"
     `([NUMBER,APC],REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE,ONUMBER)'

     The ONUMBER, or the REGISTER, or both, may be omitted.  Either the
     NUMBER or the APC may be omitted, but not both.

"Preindex"
     `([NUMBER,APC,REGISTER.SIZE*SCALE],ONUMBER)'

     The NUMBER, or the APC, or the REGISTER, or any two of them, may
     be omitted.  The ONUMBER may be omitted.  The REGISTER and the APC
     may appear in either order.  If both APC and REGISTER are address
     registers, and the SIZE and SCALE are omitted, then the first
     register is taken as the base register, and the second as the
     index register.

`.data2'
     This directive is identical to a `.data 2' directive.

`.even'
     This directive is a special case of the `.align' directive; it
     aligns the output to an even byte boundary.

`.skip'

8.18.6.1 Branch Improvement
...........................

Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted for branch instructions.  They
expand to the shortest branch instruction that reach the target.
Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting `j' for `b' at the
start of a Motorola mnemonic.

   The following table summarizes the pseudo-operations.  A `*' flags
cases that are more fully described after the table:

               Displacement
               +------------------------------------------------------------
               |                68020           68000/10, not PC-relative OK
     Pseudo-Op |BYTE    WORD    LONG            ABSOLUTE LONG JUMP    **
               +------------------------------------------------------------
          jbsr |bsrs    bsrw    bsrl            jsr
           jra |bras    braw    bral            jmp
     *     jXX |bXXs    bXXw    bXXl            bNXs;jmp
     *    dbXX | N/A    dbXXw   dbXX;bras;bral  dbXX;bras;jmp
          fjXX | N/A    fbXXw   fbXXl            N/A

     XX: condition
     NX: negative of condition XX
                       `*'--see full description below
         `**'--this expansion mode is disallowed by `--pcrel'

`jbsr'
`jra'
     These are the simplest jump pseudo-operations; they always map to
     one particular machine instruction, depending on the displacement
     to the branch target.  This instruction will be a byte or word
     branch is that is sufficient.  Otherwise, a long branch will be
     emitted if available.  If no long branches are available and the
     `--pcrel' option is not given, an absolute long jump will be
     emitted instead.  If no long branches are available, the `--pcrel'
     option is given, and a word branch cannot reach the target, an
     error message is generated.

     In addition to standard branch operands, `as' allows these
     pseudo-operations to have all operands that are allowed for jsr
     and jmp, substituting these instructions if the operand given is
     not valid for a branch instruction.

`jXX'
     Here, `jXX' stands for an entire family of pseudo-operations,
     where XX is a conditional branch or condition-code test.  The full
     list of pseudo-ops in this family is:
           jhi   jls   jcc   jcs   jne   jeq   jvc
           jvs   jpl   jmi   jge   jlt   jgt   jle

     Usually, each of these pseudo-operations expands to a single branch
     instruction.  However, if a word branch is not sufficient, no long
     branches are available, and the `--pcrel' option is not given, `as'
     issues a longer code fragment in terms of NX, the opposite
     condition to XX.  For example, under these conditions:
              jXX foo
     gives
               bNXs oof
               jmp foo
           oof:

`dbXX'
     The full family of pseudo-operations covered here is
           dbhi   dbls   dbcc   dbcs   dbne   dbeq   dbvc
           dbvs   dbpl   dbmi   dbge   dblt   dbgt   dble
           dbf    dbra   dbt

     Motorola `dbXX' instructions allow word displacements only.  When
     a word displacement is sufficient, each of these pseudo-operations
     expands to the corresponding Motorola instruction.  When a word
     displacement is not sufficient and long branches are available,
     when the source reads `dbXX foo', `as' emits
               dbXX oo1
               bras oo2
           oo1:bral foo
           oo2:

     If, however, long branches are not available and the `--pcrel'
     option is not given, `as' emits
               dbXX oo1
               bras oo2
           oo1:jmp foo
           oo2:

`fjXX'
     This family includes
           fjne   fjeq   fjge   fjlt   fjgt   fjle   fjf
           fjt    fjgl   fjgle  fjnge  fjngl  fjngle fjngt
           fjnle  fjnlt  fjoge  fjogl  fjogt  fjole  fjolt
           fjor   fjseq  fjsf   fjsne  fjst   fjueq  fjuge
           fjugt  fjule  fjult  fjun

     Each of these pseudo-operations always expands to a single Motorola
     coprocessor branch instruction, word or long.  All Motorola
     coprocessor branch instructions allow both word and long
     displacements.

8.18.6.2 Special Characters
...........................

The immediate character is `#' for Sun compatibility.  The line-comment
character is `|' (unless the `--bitwise-or' option is used).  If a `#'
appears at the beginning of a line, it is treated as a comment unless
it looks like `# line file', in which case it is treated normally.

8.19.1 M68HC11 and M68HC12 Options
----------------------------------

The Motorola 68HC11 and 68HC12 version of `as' have a few machine
dependent options.

`-m68hc11'
     This option switches the assembler in the M68HC11 mode. In this
     mode, the assembler only accepts 68HC11 operands and mnemonics. It
     produces code for the 68HC11.

`-m68hc12'
     This option switches the assembler in the M68HC12 mode. In this
     mode, the assembler also accepts 68HC12 operands and mnemonics. It
     produces code for the 68HC12. A few 68HC11 instructions are
     replaced by some 68HC12 instructions as recommended by Motorola
     specifications.

`-m68hcs12'
     This option switches the assembler in the M68HCS12 mode.  This
     mode is similar to `-m68hc12' but specifies to assemble for the
     68HCS12 series.  The only difference is on the assembling of the
     `movb' and `movw' instruction when a PC-relative operand is used.

`-mshort'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 16-bit integer
     ABI.  It has no effect on the assembled instructions.  This is the
     default.

`-mlong'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit integer
     ABI.

`-mshort-double'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 32-bit float
     ABI.  This is the default.

`-mlong-double'
     This option controls the ABI and indicates to use a 64-bit float
     ABI.

`--strict-direct-mode'
     You can use the `--strict-direct-mode' option to disable the
     automatic translation of direct page mode addressing into extended
     mode when the instruction does not support direct mode.  For
     example, the `clr' instruction does not support direct page mode
     addressing. When it is used with the direct page mode, `as' will
     ignore it and generate an absolute addressing.  This option
     prevents `as' from doing this, and the wrong usage of the direct
     page mode will raise an error.

`--short-branchs'
     The `--short-branchs' option turns off the translation of relative
     branches into absolute branches when the branch offset is out of
     range. By default `as' transforms the relative branch (`bsr',
     `bgt', `bge', `beq', `bne', `ble', `blt', `bhi', `bcc', `bls',
     `bcs', `bmi', `bvs', `bvs', `bra') into an absolute branch when
     the offset is out of the -128 .. 127 range.  In that case, the
     `bsr' instruction is translated into a `jsr', the `bra'
     instruction is translated into a `jmp' and the conditional branchs
     instructions are inverted and followed by a `jmp'. This option
     disables these translations and `as' will generate an error if a
     relative branch is out of range. This option does not affect the
     optimization associated to the `jbra', `jbsr' and `jbXX' pseudo
     opcodes.

`--force-long-branchs'
     The `--force-long-branchs' option forces the translation of
     relative branches into absolute branches. This option does not
     affect the optimization associated to the `jbra', `jbsr' and
     `jbXX' pseudo opcodes.

`--print-insn-syntax'
     You can use the `--print-insn-syntax' option to obtain the syntax
     description of the instruction when an error is detected.

`--print-opcodes'
     The `--print-opcodes' option prints the list of all the
     instructions with their syntax. The first item of each line
     represents the instruction name and the rest of the line indicates
     the possible operands for that instruction. The list is printed in
     alphabetical order. Once the list is printed `as' exits.

`--generate-example'
     The `--generate-example' option is similar to `--print-opcodes'
     but it generates an example for each instruction instead.

8.19.2 Syntax
-------------

In the M68HC11 syntax, the instruction name comes first and it may be
followed by one or several operands (up to three). Operands are
separated by comma (`,'). In the normal mode, `as' will complain if too
many operands are specified for a given instruction. In the MRI mode
(turned on with `-M' option), it will treat them as comments. Example:

     inx
     lda  #23
     bset 2,x #4
     brclr *bot #8 foo

   The following addressing modes are understood for 68HC11 and 68HC12:
"Immediate"
     `#NUMBER'

"Address Register"
     `NUMBER,X', `NUMBER,Y'

     The NUMBER may be omitted in which case 0 is assumed.

"Direct Addressing mode"
     `*SYMBOL', or `*DIGITS'

"Absolute"
     `SYMBOL', or `DIGITS'

   The M68HC12 has other more complex addressing modes. All of them are
supported and they are represented below:

"Constant Offset Indexed Addressing Mode"
     `NUMBER,REG'

     The NUMBER may be omitted in which case 0 is assumed.  The
     register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.  The assembler will
     use the smaller post-byte definition according to the constant
     value (5-bit constant offset, 9-bit constant offset or 16-bit
     constant offset).  If the constant is not known by the assembler
     it will use the 16-bit constant offset post-byte and the value
     will be resolved at link time.

"Offset Indexed Indirect"
     `[NUMBER,REG]'

     The register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.

"Auto Pre-Increment/Pre-Decrement/Post-Increment/Post-Decrement"
     `NUMBER,-REG' `NUMBER,+REG' `NUMBER,REG-' `NUMBER,REG+'

     The number must be in the range `-8'..`+8' and must not be 0.  The
     register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.

"Accumulator Offset"
     `ACC,REG'

     The accumulator register can be either `A', `B' or `D'.  The
     register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.

"Accumulator D offset indexed-indirect"
     `[D,REG]'

     The register can be either `X', `Y', `SP' or `PC'.


   For example:

     ldab 1024,sp
     ldd [10,x]
     orab 3,+x
     stab -2,y-
     ldx a,pc
     sty [d,sp]

8.19.3 Symbolic Operand Modifiers
---------------------------------

The assembler supports several modifiers when using symbol addresses in
68HC11 and 68HC12 instruction operands.  The general syntax is the
following:

     %modifier(symbol)

`%addr'
     This modifier indicates to the assembler and linker to use the
     16-bit physical address corresponding to the symbol.  This is
     intended to be used on memory window systems to map a symbol in
     the memory bank window.  If the symbol is in a memory expansion
     part, the physical address corresponds to the symbol address
     within the memory bank window.  If the symbol is not in a memory
     expansion part, this is the symbol address (using or not using the
     %addr modifier has no effect in that case).

`%page'
     This modifier indicates to use the memory page number corresponding
     to the symbol.  If the symbol is in a memory expansion part, its
     page number is computed by the linker as a number used to map the
     page containing the symbol in the memory bank window.  If the
     symbol is not in a memory expansion part, the page number is 0.

`%hi'
     This modifier indicates to use the 8-bit high part of the physical
     address of the symbol.

`%lo'
     This modifier indicates to use the 8-bit low part of the physical
     address of the symbol.


   For example a 68HC12 call to a function `foo_example' stored in
memory expansion part could be written as follows:

     call %addr(foo_example),%page(foo_example)

   and this is equivalent to

     call foo_example

   And for 68HC11 it could be written as follows:

     ldab #%page(foo_example)
     stab _page_switch
     jsr  %addr(foo_example)

8.19.4 Assembler Directives
---------------------------

The 68HC11 and 68HC12 version of `as' have the following specific
assembler directives:

`.relax'
     The relax directive is used by the `GNU Compiler' to emit a
     specific relocation to mark a group of instructions for linker
     relaxation.  The sequence of instructions within the group must be
     known to the linker so that relaxation can be performed.

`.mode [mshort|mlong|mshort-double|mlong-double]'
     This directive specifies the ABI.  It overrides the `-mshort',
     `-mlong', `-mshort-double' and `-mlong-double' options.

`.far SYMBOL'
     This directive marks the symbol as a `far' symbol meaning that it
     uses a `call/rtc' calling convention as opposed to `jsr/rts'.
     During a final link, the linker will identify references to the
     `far' symbol and will verify the proper calling convention.

`.interrupt SYMBOL'
     This directive marks the symbol as an interrupt entry point.  This
     information is then used by the debugger to correctly unwind the
     frame across interrupts.

`.xrefb SYMBOL'
     This directive is defined for compatibility with the
     `Specification for Motorola 8 and 16-Bit Assembly Language Input
     Standard' and is ignored.

8.19.5 Floating Point
---------------------

Packed decimal (P) format floating literals are not supported.  Feel
free to add the code!

   The floating point formats generated by directives are these.

`.float'
     `Single' precision floating point constants.

`.double'
     `Double' precision floating point constants.

8.19.6.1 Branch Improvement
...........................

Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted for branch instructions.  They
expand to the shortest branch instruction that reach the target.
Generally these mnemonics are made by prepending `j' to the start of
Motorola mnemonic. These pseudo opcodes are not affected by the
`--short-branchs' or `--force-long-branchs' options.

     XX: condition

`jbsr'
`jbra'
     These are the simplest jump pseudo-operations; they always map to
     one particular machine instruction, depending on the displacement
     to the branch target.

`jbXX'
     Here, `jbXX' stands for an entire family of pseudo-operations,
     where XX is a conditional branch or condition-code test.  The full
     list of pseudo-ops in this family is:

           jbcs   jbne   jblt   jble   jbls   jbvc   jbmi

     For the cases of non-PC relative displacements and long
     displacements, `as' issues a longer code fragment in terms of NX,
     the opposite condition to XX.  For example, for the non-PC
     relative case:
              jbXX foo
     gives
               bNXs oof

File: as.info,  Node: M88K Directives,  Up: M88K-Dependent

8.20.1 M88K Machine Directives
------------------------------

The M88K version of the assembler supports the following machine
directives:

`.align'
     This directive aligns the section program counter on the next
     4-byte boundary.

`.dfloat EXPR'
     This assembles a double precision (64-bit) floating point constant.

`.ffloat EXPR'
     This assembles a single precision (32-bit) floating point constant.

`.half EXPR'
     This directive assembles a half-word (16-bit) constant.

`.word EXPR'
     This assembles a word (32-bit) constant.

`.string "STR"'
     This directive behaves like the standard `.ascii' directive for
     copying STR into the object file.  The string is not terminated
     with a null byte.

`.set SYMBOL, VALUE'
     This directive creates a symbol named SYMBOL which is an alias for
     another symbol (possibly not yet defined).  This should not be
     confused with the mnemonic `set', which is a legitimate M88K
     instruction.

`.def SYMBOL, VALUE'
     This directive is synonymous with `.set' and is presumably provided
     for compatibility with other M88K assemblers.

`.bss SYMBOL, LENGTH, ALIGN'
     Reserve LENGTH bytes in the bss section for a local SYMBOL,
     aligned to the power of two specified by ALIGN.  LENGTH and ALIGN
     must be positive absolute expressions.  This directive differs
     from `.lcomm' only in that it permits you to specify an alignment.
     *Note `.lcomm': Lcomm.

8.21.1 Assembler options
------------------------

The MIPS configurations of GNU `as' support these special options:

`-G NUM'
     This option sets the largest size of an object that can be
     referenced implicitly with the `gp' register.  It is only accepted
     for targets that use ECOFF format.  The default value is 8.

`-EB'
`-EL'
     Any MIPS configuration of `as' can select big-endian or
     little-endian output at run time (unlike the other GNU development
     tools, which must be configured for one or the other).  Use `-EB'
     to select big-endian output, and `-EL' for little-endian.

`-mips1'
`-mips2'
`-mips3'
`-mips4'
`-mips5'
`-mips32'
`-mips32r2'
`-mips64'
`-mips64r2'
     Generate code for a particular MIPS Instruction Set Architecture
     level.  `-mips1' corresponds to the R2000 and R3000 processors,
     `-mips2' to the R6000 processor, `-mips3' to the R4000 processor,
     and `-mips4' to the R8000 and R10000 processors.  `-mips5',
     `-mips32', `-mips32r2', `-mips64', and `-mips64r2' correspond to
     generic MIPS V, MIPS32, MIPS32 RELEASE 2, MIPS64, and MIPS64
     RELEASE 2 ISA processors, respectively.  You can also switch
     instruction sets during the assembly; see *Note Directives to
     override the ISA level: MIPS ISA.

`-mgp32'
`-mfp32'
     Some macros have different expansions for 32-bit and 64-bit
     registers.  The register sizes are normally inferred from the ISA
     and ABI, but these flags force a certain group of registers to be
     treated as 32 bits wide at all times.  `-mgp32' controls the size
     of general-purpose registers and `-mfp32' controls the size of
     floating-point registers.

     On some MIPS variants there is a 32-bit mode flag; when this flag
     is set, 64-bit instructions generate a trap.  Also, some 32-bit
     OSes only save the 32-bit registers on a context switch, so it is
     essential never to use the 64-bit registers.

`-mgp64'
     Assume that 64-bit general purpose registers are available.  This
     is provided in the interests of symmetry with -gp32.

`-mips16'
`-no-mips16'
     Generate code for the MIPS 16 processor.  This is equivalent to
     putting `.set mips16' at the start of the assembly file.
     `-no-mips16' turns off this option.

`-mips3d'
`-no-mips3d'
     Generate code for the MIPS-3D Application Specific Extension.
     This tells the assembler to accept MIPS-3D instructions.
     `-no-mips3d' turns off this option.

`-mdmx'
`-no-mdmx'
     Generate code for the MDMX Application Specific Extension.  This
     tells the assembler to accept MDMX instructions.  `-no-mdmx' turns
     off this option.

`-mfix7000'
`-mno-fix7000'
     Cause nops to be inserted if the read of the destination register
     of an mfhi or mflo instruction occurs in the following two
     instructions.

`-mfix-vr4120'
`-no-mfix-vr4120'
     Insert nops to work around certain VR4120 errata.  This option is
     intended to be used on GCC-generated code: it is not designed to
     catch all problems in hand-written assembler code.

`-m4010'
`-no-m4010'
     Generate code for the LSI R4010 chip.  This tells the assembler to
     accept the R4010 specific instructions (`addciu', `ffc', etc.),
     and to not schedule `nop' instructions around accesses to the `HI'
     and `LO' registers.  `-no-m4010' turns off this option.

`-m4650'
`-no-m4650'
     Generate code for the MIPS R4650 chip.  This tells the assembler
     to accept the `mad' and `madu' instruction, and to not schedule
     `nop' instructions around accesses to the `HI' and `LO' registers.
     `-no-m4650' turns off this option.

`-m3900'
`-no-m3900'
`-m4100'
`-no-m4100'
     For each option `-mNNNN', generate code for the MIPS RNNNN chip.
     This tells the assembler to accept instructions specific to that
     chip, and to schedule for that chip's hazards.

`-march=CPU'
     Generate code for a particular MIPS cpu.  It is exactly equivalent
     to `-mCPU', except that there are more value of CPU understood.
     Valid CPU value are:

          2000, 3000, 3900, 4000, 4010, 4100, 4111, vr4120, vr4130,
          vr4181, 4300, 4400, 4600, 4650, 5000, rm5200, rm5230, rm5231,
          rm5261, rm5721, vr5400, vr5500, 6000, rm7000, 8000, rm9000,
          10000, 12000, mips32-4k, sb1

`-mtune=CPU'
     Schedule and tune for a particular MIPS cpu.  Valid CPU values are
     identical to `-march=CPU'.

`-mabi=ABI'
     Record which ABI the source code uses.  The recognized arguments
     are: `32', `n32', `o64', `64' and `eabi'.

`-msym32'
`-mno-sym32'
     Equivalent to adding `.set sym32' or `.set nosym32' to the
     beginning of the assembler input.  *Note MIPS symbol sizes::.

`-nocpp'
     This option is ignored.  It is accepted for command-line
     compatibility with other assemblers, which use it to turn off C
     style preprocessing.  With GNU `as', there is no need for
     `-nocpp', because the GNU assembler itself never runs the C
     preprocessor.

`--construct-floats'
`--no-construct-floats'
     The `--no-construct-floats' option disables the construction of
     double width floating point constants by loading the two halves of
     the value into the two single width floating point registers that
     make up the double width register.  This feature is useful if the
     processor support the FR bit in its status  register, and this bit
     is known (by the programmer) to be set.  This bit prevents the
     aliasing of the double width register by the single width
     registers.

     By default `--construct-floats' is selected, allowing construction
     of these floating point constants.

`--trap'
`--no-break'
     `as' automatically macro expands certain division and
     multiplication instructions to check for overflow and division by
     zero.  This option causes `as' to generate code to take a trap
     exception rather than a break exception when an error is detected.
     The trap instructions are only supported at Instruction Set
     Architecture level 2 and higher.

`--break'
`--no-trap'
     Generate code to take a break exception rather than a trap
     exception when an error is detected.  This is the default.

`-mpdr'
`-mno-pdr'
     Control generation of `.pdr' sections.  Off by default on IRIX, on
     elsewhere.

`-mshared'
`-mno-shared'
     When generating code using the Unix calling conventions (selected
     by `-KPIC' or `-mcall_shared'), gas will normally generate code
     which can go into a shared library.  The `-mno-shared' option
     tells gas to generate code which uses the calling convention, but
     can not go into a shared library.  The resulting code is slightly
     more efficient.  This option only affects the handling of the
     `.cpload' and `.cpsetup' pseudo-ops.

8.21.2 MIPS ECOFF object code
-----------------------------

Assembling for a MIPS ECOFF target supports some additional sections
besides the usual `.text', `.data' and `.bss'.  The additional sections
are `.rdata', used for read-only data, `.sdata', used for small data,
and `.sbss', used for small common objects.

   When assembling for ECOFF, the assembler uses the `$gp' (`$28')
register to form the address of a "small object".  Any object in the
`.sdata' or `.sbss' sections is considered "small" in this sense.  For
external objects, or for objects in the `.bss' section, you can use the
`gcc' `-G' option to control the size of objects addressed via `$gp';
the default value is 8, meaning that a reference to any object eight
bytes or smaller uses `$gp'.  Passing `-G 0' to `as' prevents it from
using the `$gp' register on the basis of object size (but the assembler
uses `$gp' for objects in `.sdata' or `sbss' in any case).  The size of
an object in the `.bss' section is set by the `.comm' or `.lcomm'
directive that defines it.  The size of an external object may be set
with the `.extern' directive.  For example, `.extern sym,4' declares
that the object at `sym' is 4 bytes in length, whie leaving `sym'
otherwise undefined.

   Using small ECOFF objects requires linker support, and assumes that
the `$gp' register is correctly initialized (normally done
automatically by the startup code).  MIPS ECOFF assembly code must not
modify the `$gp' register.

8.21.3 Directives for debugging information
-------------------------------------------

MIPS ECOFF `as' supports several directives used for generating
debugging information which are not support by traditional MIPS
assemblers.  These are `.def', `.endef', `.dim', `.file', `.scl',
`.size', `.tag', `.type', `.val', `.stabd', `.stabn', and `.stabs'.
The debugging information generated by the three `.stab' directives can
only be read by GDB, not by traditional MIPS debuggers (this
enhancement is required to fully support C++ debugging).  These
directives are primarily used by compilers, not assembly language
programmers!


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS symbol sizes,  Next: MIPS autoextend,  Prev: MIPS ISA,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

8.21.4 Directives to override the size of symbols
-------------------------------------------------

The n64 ABI allows symbols to have any 64-bit value.  Although this
provides a great deal of flexibility, it means that some macros have
much longer expansions than their 32-bit counterparts.  For example,
the non-PIC expansion of `dla $4,sym' is usually:

     lui     $4,%highest(sym)
     lui     $1,%hi(sym)
     daddiu  $4,$4,%higher(sym)
     daddiu  $1,$1,%lo(sym)
     dsll32  $4,$4,0
     daddu   $4,$4,$1

   whereas the 32-bit expansion is simply:

     lui     $4,%hi(sym)
     daddiu  $4,$4,%lo(sym)

   n64 code is sometimes constructed in such a way that all symbolic
constants are known to have 32-bit values, and in such cases, it's
preferable to use the 32-bit expansion instead of the 64-bit expansion.

   You can use the `.set sym32' directive to tell the assembler that,
from this point on, all expressions of the form `SYMBOL' or `SYMBOL +
OFFSET' have 32-bit values.  For example:

     .set sym32
     dla     $4,sym
     lw      $4,sym+16
     sw      $4,sym+0x8000($4)

   will cause the assembler to treat `sym', `sym+16' and `sym+0x8000'
as 32-bit values.  The handling of non-symbolic addresses is not
affected.

   The directive `.set nosym32' ends a `.set sym32' block and reverts
to the normal behavior.  It is also possible to change the symbol size
using the command-line options `-msym32' and `-mno-sym32'.

   These options and directives are always accepted, but at present,
they have no effect for anything other than n64.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS ISA,  Next: MIPS symbol sizes,  Prev: MIPS Stabs,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

8.21.5 Directives to override the ISA level
-------------------------------------------

GNU `as' supports an additional directive to change the MIPS
Instruction Set Architecture level on the fly: `.set mipsN'.  N should
be a number from 0 to 5, or 32, 32r2, 64 or 64r2.  The values other
than 0 make the assembler accept instructions for the corresponding ISA
level, from that point on in the assembly.  `.set mipsN' affects not
only which instructions are permitted, but also how certain macros are
expanded.  `.set mips0' restores the ISA level to its original level:
either the level you selected with command line options, or the default
for your configuration.  You can use this feature to permit specific
R4000 instructions while assembling in 32 bit mode.  Use this directive
with care!

   The directive `.set mips16' puts the assembler into MIPS 16 mode, in
which it will assemble instructions for the MIPS 16 processor.  Use
`.set nomips16' to return to normal 32 bit mode.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS autoextend,  Next: MIPS insn,  Prev: MIPS symbol sizes,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

8.21.6 Directives for extending MIPS 16 bit instructions
--------------------------------------------------------

By default, MIPS 16 instructions are automatically extended to 32 bits
when necessary.  The directive `.set noautoextend' will turn this off.
When `.set noautoextend' is in effect, any 32 bit instruction must be
explicitly extended with the `.e' modifier (e.g., `li.e $4,1000').  The
directive `.set autoextend' may be used to once again automatically
extend instructions when necessary.

   This directive is only meaningful when in MIPS 16 mode.  Traditional
MIPS assemblers do not support this directive.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS insn,  Next: MIPS option stack,  Prev: MIPS autoextend,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

8.21.7 Directive to mark data as an instruction
-----------------------------------------------

The `.insn' directive tells `as' that the following data is actually
instructions.  This makes a difference in MIPS 16 mode: when loading
the address of a label which precedes instructions, `as' automatically
adds 1 to the value, so that jumping to the loaded address will do the
right thing.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS option stack,  Next: MIPS ASE instruction generation overrides,  Prev: MIPS insn,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

8.21.8 Directives to save and restore options
---------------------------------------------

The directives `.set push' and `.set pop' may be used to save and
restore the current settings for all the options which are controlled
by `.set'.  The `.set push' directive saves the current settings on a
stack.  The `.set pop' directive pops the stack and restores the
settings.

   These directives can be useful inside an macro which must change an
option such as the ISA level or instruction reordering but does not want
to change the state of the code which invoked the macro.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support these directives.


File: as.info,  Node: MIPS ASE instruction generation overrides,  Prev: MIPS option stack,  Up: MIPS-Dependent

8.21.9 Directives to control generation of MIPS ASE instructions
----------------------------------------------------------------

The directive `.set mips3d' makes the assembler accept instructions
from the MIPS-3D Application Specific Extension from that point on in
the assembly.  The `.set nomips3d' directive prevents MIPS-3D
instructions from being accepted.

   The directive `.set mdmx' makes the assembler accept instructions
from the MDMX Application Specific Extension from that point on in the
assembly.  The `.set nomdmx' directive prevents MDMX instructions from
being accepted.

   Traditional MIPS assemblers do not support these directives.

The MMIX version of `as' has some machine-dependent options.

   When `--fixed-special-register-names' is specified, only the register
names specified in *Note MMIX-Regs:: are recognized in the instructions
`PUT' and `GET'.

   You can use the `--globalize-symbols' to make all symbols global.
This option is useful when splitting up a `mmixal' program into several
files.

   The `--gnu-syntax' turns off most syntax compatibility with
`mmixal'.  Its usability is currently doubtful.

   The `--relax' option is not fully supported, but will eventually make
the object file prepared for linker relaxation.

   If you want to avoid inadvertently calling a predefined symbol and
would rather get an error, for example when using `as' with a compiler
or other machine-generated code, specify `--no-predefined-syms'.  This
turns off built-in predefined definitions of all such symbols,
including rounding-mode symbols, segment symbols, `BIT' symbols, and
`TRAP' symbols used in `mmix' "system calls".  It also turns off
predefined special-register names, except when used in `PUT' and `GET'
instructions.

   By default, some instructions are expanded to fit the size of the
operand or an external symbol (*note MMIX-Expand::).  By passing
`--no-expand', no such expansion will be done, instead causing errors
at link time if the operand does not fit.

   The `mmixal' documentation (*note mmixsite::) specifies that global
registers allocated with the `GREG' directive (*note MMIX-greg::) and
initialized to the same non-zero value, will refer to the same global
register.  This isn't strictly enforceable in `as' since the final
addresses aren't known until link-time, but it will do an effort unless
the `--no-merge-gregs' option is specified.  (Register merging isn't
yet implemented in `ld'.)

   `as' will warn every time it expands an instruction to fit an
operand unless the option `-x' is specified.  It is believed that this
behaviour is more useful than just mimicking `mmixal''s behaviour, in
which instructions are only expanded if the `-x' option is specified,
and assembly fails otherwise, when an instruction needs to be expanded.
It needs to be kept in mind that `mmixal' is both an assembler and
linker, while `as' will expand instructions that at link stage can be
contracted.  (Though linker relaxation isn't yet implemented in `ld'.)
The option `-x' also imples `--linker-allocated-gregs'.

   If instruction expansion is enabled, `as' can expand a `PUSHJ'
instruction into a series of instructions.  The shortest expansion is
to not expand it, but just mark the call as redirectable to a stub,
which `ld' creates at link-time, but only if the original `PUSHJ'
instruction is found not to reach the target.  The stub consists of the
necessary instructions to form a jump to the target.  This happens if
`as' can assert that the `PUSHJ' instruction can reach such a stub.
The option `--no-pushj-stubs' disables this shorter expansion, and the
longer series of instructions is then created at assembly-time.  The
option `--no-stubs' is a synonym, intended for compatibility with
future releases, where generation of stubs for other instructions may
be implemented.

   Usually a two-operand-expression (*note GREG-base::) without a
matching `GREG' directive is treated as an error by `as'.  When the
option `--linker-allocated-gregs' is in effect, they are instead passed
through to the linker, which will allocate as many global registers as
is needed.

8.22.2 Instruction expansion
----------------------------

When `as' encounters an instruction with an operand that is either not
known or does not fit the operand size of the instruction, `as' (and
`ld') will expand the instruction into a sequence of instructions
semantically equivalent to the operand fitting the instruction.
Expansion will take place for the following instructions:

`GETA'
     Expands to a sequence of four instructions: `SETL', `INCML',
     `INCMH' and `INCH'.  The operand must be a multiple of four.

Conditional branches
     A branch instruction is turned into a branch with the complemented
     condition and prediction bit over five instructions; four
     instructions setting `$255' to the operand value, which like with
     `GETA' must be a multiple of four, and a final `GO $255,$255,0'.

`PUSHJ'
     Similar to expansion for conditional branches; four instructions
     set `$255' to the operand value, followed by a `PUSHGO
     $255,$255,0'.

`JMP'
     Similar to conditional branches and `PUSHJ'.  The final instruction
     is `GO $255,$255,0'.

   The linker `ld' is expected to shrink these expansions for code
assembled with `--relax' (though not currently implemented).

8.22.3 Syntax
-------------

The assembly syntax is supposed to be upward compatible with that
described in Sections 1.3 and 1.4 of `The Art of Computer Programming,
Volume 1'.  Draft versions of those chapters as well as other MMIX
information is located at
`http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix-news.html'.  Most code
examples from the mmixal package located there should work unmodified
when assembled and linked as single files, with a few noteworthy
exceptions (*note MMIX-mmixal::).

   Before an instruction is emitted, the current location is aligned to
the next four-byte boundary.  If a label is defined at the beginning of
the line, its value will be the aligned value.

   In addition to the traditional hex-prefix `0x', a hexadecimal number
can also be specified by the prefix character `#'.

   After all operands to an MMIX instruction or directive have been
specified, the rest of the line is ignored, treated as a comment.

8.22.3.1 Special Characters
...........................

The characters `*' and `#' are line comment characters; each start a
comment at the beginning of a line, but only at the beginning of a
line.  A `#' prefixes a hexadecimal number if found elsewhere on a line.

   Two other characters, `%' and `!', each start a comment anywhere on
the line.  Thus you can't use the `modulus' and `not' operators in
expressions normally associated with these two characters.

   A `;' is a line separator, treated as a new-line, so separate
instructions can be specified on a single line.


File: as.info,  Node: MMIX-Symbols,  Next: MMIX-Regs,  Prev: MMIX-Chars,  Up: MMIX-Syntax

8.22.3.2 Symbols
................

The character `:' is permitted in identifiers.  There are two
exceptions to it being treated as any other symbol character: if a
symbol begins with `:', it means that the symbol is in the global
namespace and that the current prefix should not be prepended to that
symbol (*note MMIX-prefix::).  The `:' is then not considered part of
the symbol.  For a symbol in the label position (first on a line), a `:'
at the end of a symbol is silently stripped off.  A label is permitted,
but not required, to be followed by a `:', as with many other assembly
formats.

   The character `@@' in an expression, is a synonym for `.', the
current location.

   In addition to the common forward and backward local symbol formats
(*note Symbol Names::), they can be specified with upper-case `B' and
`F', as in `8B' and `9F'.  A local label defined for the current
position is written with a `H' appended to the number:
     3H LDB $0,$1,2
   This and traditional local-label formats cannot be mixed: a label
must be defined and referred to using the same format.

   There's a minor caveat: just as for the ordinary local symbols, the
local symbols are translated into ordinary symbols using control
characters are to hide the ordinal number of the symbol.
Unfortunately, these symbols are not translated back in error messages.
Thus you may see confusing error messages when local symbols are used.
Control characters `\003' (control-C) and `\004' (control-D) are used
for the MMIX-specific local-symbol syntax.

   The symbol `Main' is handled specially; it is always global.

   By defining the symbols `__.MMIX.start..text' and
`__.MMIX.start..data', the address of respectively the `.text' and
`.data' segments of the final program can be defined, though when
linking more than one object file, the code or data in the object file
containing the symbol is not guaranteed to be start at that position;
just the final executable.  *Note MMIX-loc::.

8.22.3.3 Register names
.......................

Local and global registers are specified as `$0' to `$255'.  The
recognized special register names are `rJ', `rA', `rB', `rC', `rD',
`rE', `rF', `rG', `rH', `rI', `rK', `rL', `rM', `rN', `rO', `rP', `rQ',
`rR', `rS', `rT', `rU', `rV', `rW', `rX', `rY', `rZ', `rBB', `rTT',
`rWW', `rXX', `rYY' and `rZZ'.  A leading `:' is optional for special
register names.

   Local and global symbols can be equated to register names and used in
place of ordinary registers.

   Similarly for special registers, local and global symbols can be
used.  Also, symbols equated from numbers and constant expressions are
allowed in place of a special register, except when either of the
options `--no-predefined-syms' and `--fixed-special-register-names' are
specified.  Then only the special register names above are allowed for
the instructions having a special register operand; `GET' and `PUT'.

8.22.3.4 Assembler Directives
.............................

`LOC'
     The `LOC' directive sets the current location to the value of the
     operand field, which may include changing sections.  If the
     operand is a constant, the section is set to either `.data' if the
     value is `0x2000000000000000' or larger, else it is set to `.text'.
     Within a section, the current location may only be changed to
     monotonically higher addresses.  A LOC expression must be a
     previously defined symbol or a "pure" constant.

     An example, which sets the label PREV to the current location, and
     updates the current location to eight bytes forward:
          prev LOC @@+8

     When a LOC has a constant as its operand, a symbol
     `__.MMIX.start..text' or `__.MMIX.start..data' is defined
     depending on the address as mentioned above.  Each such symbol is
     interpreted as special by the linker, locating the section at that
     address.  Note that if multiple files are linked, the first object
     file with that section will be mapped to that address (not
     necessarily the file with the LOC definition).

`LOCAL'
     Example:
           LOCAL external_symbol
           LOCAL 42
           .local asymbol

     This directive-operation generates a link-time assertion that the
     operand does not correspond to a global register.  The operand is
     an expression that at link-time resolves to a register symbol or a
     number.  A number is treated as the register having that number.
     There is one restriction on the use of this directive: the
     pseudo-directive must be placed in a section with contents, code
     or data.

`IS'
     The `IS' directive:
          asymbol IS an_expression
     sets the symbol `asymbol' to `an_expression'.  A symbol may not be
     set more than once using this directive.  Local labels may be set
     using this directive, for example:
          5H IS @@+4

`GREG'
     This directive reserves a global register, gives it an initial
     value and optionally gives it a symbolic name.  Some examples:

          areg GREG
          breg GREG data_value
               GREG data_buffer
               .greg creg, another_data_value

     The symbolic register name can be used in place of a (non-special)
     register.  If a value isn't provided, it defaults to zero.  Unless
     the option `--no-merge-gregs' is specified, non-zero registers
     allocated with this directive may be eliminated by `as'; another
     register with the same value used in its place.  Any of the
     instructions `CSWAP', `GO', `LDA', `LDBU', `LDB', `LDHT', `LDOU',
     `LDO', `LDSF', `LDTU', `LDT', `LDUNC', `LDVTS', `LDWU', `LDW',
     `PREGO', `PRELD', `PREST', `PUSHGO', `STBU', `STB', `STCO', `STHT',
     `STOU', `STSF', `STTU', `STT', `STUNC', `SYNCD', `SYNCID', can
     have a value nearby an initial value in place of its second and
     third operands.  Here, "nearby" is defined as within the range
     0...255 from the initial value of such an allocated register.

          buffer1 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
          buffer2 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
           ...
           GREG buffer1
           LDOU $42,buffer2
     In the example above, the `Y' field of the `LDOUI' instruction
     (LDOU with a constant Z) will be replaced with the global register
     allocated for `buffer1', and the `Z' field will have the value 5,
     the offset from `buffer1' to `buffer2'.  The result is equivalent
     to this code:
          buffer1 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
          buffer2 BYTE 0,0,0,0,0
           ...
          tmpreg GREG buffer1
           LDOU $42,tmpreg,(buffer2-buffer1)

     Global registers allocated with this directive are allocated in
     order higher-to-lower within a file.  Other than that, the exact
     order of register allocation and elimination is undefined.  For
     example, the order is undefined when more than one file with such
     directives are linked together.  With the options `-x' and
     `--linker-allocated-gregs', `GREG' directives for two-operand
     cases like the one mentioned above can be omitted.  Sufficient
     global registers will then be allocated by the linker.

`BYTE'
     The `BYTE' directive takes a series of operands separated by a
     comma.  If an operand is a string (*note Strings::), each
     character of that string is emitted as a byte.  Other operands
     must be constant expressions without forward references, in the
     range 0...255.  If you need operands having expressions with
     forward references, use `.byte' (*note Byte::).  An operand can be
     omitted, defaulting to a zero value.

`WYDE'
`TETRA'
`OCTA'
     The directives `WYDE', `TETRA' and `OCTA' emit constants of two,
     four and eight bytes size respectively.  Before anything else
     happens for the directive, the current location is aligned to the
     respective constant-size boundary.  If a label is defined at the
     beginning of the line, its value will be that after the alignment.
     A single operand can be omitted, defaulting to a zero value
     emitted for the directive.  Operands can be expressed as strings
     (*note Strings::), in which case each character in the string is
     emitted as a separate constant of the size indicated by the
     directive.

`PREFIX'
     The `PREFIX' directive sets a symbol name prefix to be prepended to
     all symbols (except local symbols, *note MMIX-Symbols::), that are
     not prefixed with `:', until the next `PREFIX' directive.  Such
     prefixes accumulate.  For example,
           PREFIX a
           PREFIX b
          c IS 0
     defines a symbol `abc' with the value 0.

`BSPEC'
`ESPEC'
     A pair of `BSPEC' and `ESPEC' directives delimit a section of
     special contents (without specified semantics).  Example:
           BSPEC 42
           TETRA 1,2,3
           ESPEC
     The single operand to `BSPEC' must be number in the range 0...255.
     The `BSPEC' number 80 is used by the GNU binutils implementation.

8.22.4 Differences to `mmixal'
------------------------------

The binutils `as' and `ld' combination has a few differences in
function compared to `mmixal' (*note mmixsite::).

   The replacement of a symbol with a GREG-allocated register (*note
GREG-base::) is not handled the exactly same way in `as' as in
`mmixal'.  This is apparent in the `mmixal' example file `inout.mms',
where different registers with different offsets, eventually yielding
the same address, are used in the first instruction.  This type of
difference should however not affect the function of any program unless
it has specific assumptions about the allocated register number.

   Line numbers (in the `mmo' object format) are currently not
supported.

   Expression operator precedence is not that of mmixal: operator
precedence is that of the C programming language.  It's recommended to
use parentheses to explicitly specify wanted operator precedence
whenever more than one type of operators are used.

   The serialize unary operator `&', the fractional division operator
`//', the logical not operator `!' and the modulus operator `%' are not
available.

   Symbols are not global by default, unless the option
`--globalize-symbols' is passed.  Use the `.global' directive to
globalize symbols (*note Global::).

   Operand syntax is a bit stricter with `as' than `mmixal'.  For
example, you can't say `addu 1,2,3', instead you must write `addu
$1,$2,3'.

   You can't LOC to a lower address than those already visited (i.e.
"backwards").

   A LOC directive must come before any emitted code.

   Predefined symbols are visible as file-local symbols after use.  (In
the ELF file, that is--the linked mmo file has no notion of a file-local
symbol.)

   Some mapping of constant expressions to sections in LOC expressions
is attempted, but that functionality is easily confused and should be
avoided unless compatibility with `mmixal' is required.  A LOC
expression to `0x2000000000000000' or higher, maps to the `.data'
section and lower addresses map to the `.text' section (*note
MMIX-loc::).

   The code and data areas are each contiguous.  Sparse programs with
far-away LOC directives will take up the same amount of space as a
contiguous program with zeros filled in the gaps between the LOC
directives.  If you need sparse programs, you might try and get the
wanted effect with a linker script and splitting up the code parts into
sections (*note Section::).  Assembly code for this, to be compatible
with `mmixal', would look something like:
      .if 0
      LOC away_expression
      .else
      .section away,"ax"
      .fi
   `as' will not execute the LOC directive and `mmixal' ignores the
lines with `.'.  This construct can be used generally to help
compatibility.

   Symbols can't be defined twice-not even to the same value.

   Instruction mnemonics are recognized case-insensitive, though the
`IS' and `GREG' pseudo-operations must be specified in upper-case
characters.

   There's no unicode support.

   The following is a list of programs in `mmix.tar.gz', available at
`http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/mmix-news.html', last
checked with the version dated 2001-08-25 (md5sum
c393470cfc86fac040487d22d2bf0172) that assemble with `mmixal' but do
not assemble with `as':

`silly.mms'
     LOC to a previous address.

`sim.mms'
     Redefines symbol `Done'.

`test.mms'
     Uses the serial operator `&'.

case; for example, `r13' and `R7' are both valid register names.

   Register names `PC', `SP' and `SR' cannot be used as register names
and will be treated as variables. Use `r0', `r1', and `r2' instead.

8.23.6 Profiling Capability
---------------------------

It is a performance hit to use gcc's profiling approach for this tiny
target.  Even more - jtag hardware facility does not perform any
profiling functions.  However we've got gdb's built-in simulator where
we can do anything.

   We define new section `.profiler' which holds all profiling
information.  We define new pseudo operation `.profiler' which will
instruct assembler to add new profile entry to the object file. Profile
should take place at the present address.

   Pseudo operation format:

   `.profiler flags,function_to_profile [, cycle_corrector, extra]'

   where:

          `flags' is a combination of the following characters:

    `s'
          function entry

    `x'
          function exit

    `i'
          function is in init section

    `f'
          function is in fini section

    `l'
          library call

    `c'
          libc standard call

    `d'
          stack value demand

    `I'
          interrupt service routine

    `P'
          prologue start

    `p'
          prologue end

    `E'
          epilogue start

    `e'
          epilogue end

    `j'
          long jump / sjlj unwind

    `a'
          an arbitrary code fragment

    `t'
          extra parameter saved (a constant value like frame size)

`function_to_profile'
     a function address

`cycle_corrector'
     a value which should be added to the cycle counter, zero if
     omitted.

`extra'
     any extra parameter, zero if omitted.


   For example:
     .global fxx
     .type fxx,@@function
     fxx:
     .LFrameOffset_fxx=0x08
     .profiler "scdP", fxx     ; function entry.
     			  ; we also demand stack value to be saved
       push r11
       push r10
       push r9
       push r8
     .profiler "cdpt",fxx,0, .LFrameOffset_fxx  ; check stack value at this point
     					  ; (this is a prologue end)
     					  ; note, that spare var filled with
     					  ; the farme size
       mov r15,r8
     ...
     .profiler cdE,fxx         ; check stack
       pop r8
       pop r9
       pop r10
       pop r11
     .profiler xcde,fxx,3      ; exit adds 3 to the cycle counter
       ret                     ; cause 'ret' insn takes 3 cycles

8.24.2 Assembler Directives
---------------------------

directives.

`.bss'
     Switch to the `bss' section.

`.even'
     Align the location counter to an even number.

8.24.3 PDP-11 Assembly Language Syntax
--------------------------------------

`as' supports both DEC syntax and BSD syntax.  The only difference is
that in DEC syntax, a `#' character is used to denote an immediate
constants, while in BSD syntax the character for this purpose is `$'.

   eneral-purpose registers are named `r0' through `r7'.  Mnemonic
alternatives for `r6' and `r7' are `sp' and `pc', respectively.

   Floating-point registers are named `ac0' through `ac3', or
alternatively `fr0' through `fr3'.

   Comments are started with a `#' or a `/' character, and extend to
the end of the line.  (FIXME: clash with immediates?)

`r6', `r7', `r8', `r9', `r10', `r11', `r12', `r13', `r14', and `r15' to
refer to the SH registers.

   The SH also has these control registers:

`pr'
     procedure register (holds return address)

`pc'
     program counter

`mach'
`macl'
     high and low multiply accumulator registers

`sr'
     status register

     vector base register (for interrupt vectors)


File: as.info,  Node: SH-Addressing,  Prev: SH-Regs,  Up: SH Syntax

8.27.2.3 Addressing Modes
.........................

`as' understands the following addressing modes for the SH.  `RN' in
the following refers to any of the numbered registers, but _not_ the
control registers.

`RN'
     Register direct

`@@RN'
     Register indirect

`@@-RN'
     Register indirect with pre-decrement

`@@RN+'
     Register indirect with post-increment

`@@(DISP, RN)'
     Register indirect with displacement

`@@(R0, RN)'
     Register indexed

`@@(DISP, GBR)'
     `GBR' offset

`@@(R0, GBR)'
     GBR indexed

`ADDR'
`@@(DISP, PC)'
     PC relative address (for branch or for addressing memory).  The
     `as' implementation allows you to use the simpler form ADDR
     anywhere a PC relative address is called for; the alternate form
     is supported for compatibility with other assemblers.

`#IMM'
     Immediate data


File: as.info,  Node: SH Floating Point,  Next: SH Directives,  Prev: SH Syntax,  Up: SH-Dependent

8.27.3 Floating Point
---------------------

SH2E, SH3E and SH4 groups have on-chip floating-point unit (FPU). Other
SH groups can use `.float' directive to generate IEEE floating-point
numbers.

   SH2E and SH3E support single-precision floating point calculations as
well as entirely PCAPI compatible emulation of double-precision
floating point calculations. SH2E and SH3E instructions are a subset of
the floating point calculations conforming to the IEEE754 standard.

   In addition to single-precision and double-precision floating-point
operation capability, the on-chip FPU of SH4 has a 128-bit graphic
engine that enables 32-bit floating-point data to be processed 128 bits
at a time. It also supports 4 * 4 array operations and inner product
operations. Also, a superscalar architecture is employed that enables
simultaneous execution of two instructions (including FPU
instructions), providing performance of up to twice that of
conventional architectures at the same frequency.


File: as.info,  Node: SH Directives,  Next: SH Opcodes,  Prev: SH Floating Point,  Up: SH-Dependent

8.27.4 SH Machine Directives
----------------------------

`uaword'
`ualong'
     `as' will issue a warning when a misaligned `.word' or `.long'
     directive is used.  You may use `.uaword' or `.ualong' to indicate
     that the value is intentionally misaligned.

8.27.5 Opcodes
--------------

For detailed information on the SH machine instruction set, see
`SH-Microcomputer User's Manual' (Renesas) or `SH-4 32-bit CPU Core
Architecture' (SuperH) and `SuperH (SH) 64-Bit RISC Series' (SuperH).

   `as' implements all the standard SH opcodes.  No additional
pseudo-instructions are needed on this family.  Note, however, that
because `as' supports a simpler form of PC-relative addressing, you may
simply write (for example)

     mov.l  bar,r0

where other assemblers might require an explicit displacement to `bar'
from the program counter:

     mov.l  @@(DISP, PC)

   Here is a summary of SH opcodes:

8.28.1 Options
--------------

`-isa=sh4 | sh4a'
     Specify the sh4 or sh4a instruction set.

`-isa=dsp'
     Enable sh-dsp insns, and disable sh3e / sh4 insns.

`-isa=fp'
     Enable sh2e, sh3e, sh4, and sh4a insn sets.

`-isa=all'
     Enable sh1, sh2, sh2e, sh3, sh3e, sh4, sh4a, and sh-dsp insn sets.

`-isa=shmedia | -isa=shcompact'
     Specify the default instruction set.  `SHmedia' specifies the
     32-bit opcodes, and `SHcompact' specifies the 16-bit opcodes
     compatible with previous SH families.  The default depends on the
     ABI selected; the default for the 64-bit ABI is SHmedia, and the
     default for the 32-bit ABI is SHcompact.  If neither the ABI nor
     the ISA is specified, the default is 32-bit SHcompact.

     Note that the `.mode' pseudo-op is not permitted if the ISA is not
     specified on the command line.

`-abi=32 | -abi=64'
     Specify the default ABI.  If the ISA is specified and the ABI is
     not, the default ABI depends on the ISA, with SHmedia defaulting
     to 64-bit and SHcompact defaulting to 32-bit.

     Note that the `.abi' pseudo-op is not permitted if the ABI is not
     specified on the command line.  When the ABI is specified on the
     command line, any `.abi' pseudo-ops in the source must match it.

`-shcompact-const-crange'
     Emit code-range descriptors for constants in SHcompact code
     sections.

`-no-mix'
     Disallow SHmedia code in the same section as constants and
     SHcompact code.

`-no-expand'
     Do not expand MOVI, PT, PTA or PTB instructions.

`-expand-pt32'
     With -abi=64, expand PT, PTA and PTB instructions to 32 bits only.

   Since `$' has no special meaning, you may use it in symbol names.


File: as.info,  Node: SH64-Regs,  Next: SH64-Addressing,  Prev: SH64-Chars,  Up: SH64 Syntax

8.28.2.2 Register Names
.......................

You can use the predefined symbols `r0' through `r63' to refer to the
SH64 general registers, `cr0' through `cr63' for control registers,
`tr0' through `tr7' for target address registers, `fr0' through `fr63'
for single-precision floating point registers, `dr0' through `dr62'
(even numbered registers only) for double-precision floating point
registers, `fv0' through `fv60' (multiples of four only) for
single-precision floating point vectors, `fp0' through `fp62' (even
numbered registers only) for single-precision floating point pairs,
`mtrx0' through `mtrx48' (multiples of 16 only) for 4x4 matrices of
single-precision floating point registers, `pc' for the program
counter, and `fpscr' for the floating point status and control register.

   You can also refer to the control registers by the mnemonics `sr',
`ssr', `pssr', `intevt', `expevt', `pexpevt', `tra', `spc', `pspc',
`resvec', `vbr', `tea', `dcr', `kcr0', `kcr1', `ctc', and `usr'.


File: as.info,  Node: SH64-Addressing,  Prev: SH64-Regs,  Up: SH64 Syntax

8.28.2.3 Addressing Modes
.........................

SH64 operands consist of either a register or immediate value.  The
immediate value can be a constant or label reference (or portion of a
label reference), as in this example:

     	movi	4,r2
     	pt	function, tr4
     	movi	(function >> 16) & 65535,r0
     	shori	function & 65535, r0
     	ld.l	r0,4,r0

   Instruction label references can reference labels in either SHmedia
or SHcompact.  To differentiate between the two, labels in SHmedia
sections will always have the least significant bit set (i.e. they will
be odd), which SHcompact labels will have the least significant bit
reset (i.e. they will be even).  If you need to reference the actual
address of a label, you can use the `datalabel' modifier, as in this
example:

     	.long	function
     	.long	datalabel function

   In that example, the first longword may or may not have the least
significant bit set depending on whether the label is an SHmedia label
or an SHcompact label.  The second longword will be the actual address
of the label, regardless of what type of label it is.

8.28.3 SH64 Machine Directives
------------------------------

In addition to the SH directives, the SH64 provides the following
directives:

`.mode [shmedia|shcompact]'
`.isa [shmedia|shcompact]'
     Specify the ISA for the following instructions (the two directives
     are equivalent).  Note that programs such as `objdump' rely on
     symbolic labels to determine when such mode switches occur (by
     checking the least significant bit of the label's address), so
     such mode/isa changes should always be followed by a label (in
     practice, this is true anyway).  Note that you cannot use these
     directives if you didn't specify an ISA on the command line.

`.abi [32|64]'
     Specify the ABI for the following instructions.  Note that you
     cannot use this directive unless you specified an ABI on the
     command line, and the ABIs specified must match.

`.uaquad'
     Like .uaword and .ualong, this allows you to specify an
     intentionally unaligned quadword (64 bit word).

8.28.4 Opcodes
--------------

For detailed information on the SH64 machine instruction set, see
`SuperH 64 bit RISC Series Architecture Manual' (SuperH, Inc.).

   `as' implements all the standard SH64 opcodes.  In addition, the
following pseudo-opcodes may be expanded into one or more alternate
opcodes:

`movi'
     If the value doesn't fit into a standard `movi' opcode, `as' will
     replace the `movi' with a sequence of `movi' and `shori' opcodes.

`pt'
     This expands to a sequence of `movi' and `shori' opcode, followed
     by a `ptrel' opcode, or to a `pta' or `ptb' opcode, depending on
     the label referenced.

8.29.1 Options
--------------

The SPARC chip family includes several successive levels, using the same
core instruction set, but including a few additional instructions at
each level.  There are exceptions to this however.  For details on what
instructions each variant supports, please see the chip's architecture
reference manual.

   By default, `as' assumes the core instruction set (SPARC v6), but
"bumps" the architecture level as needed: it switches to successively
higher architectures as it encounters instructions that only exist in
the higher levels.

   If not configured for SPARC v9 (`sparc64-*-*') GAS will not bump
passed sparclite by default, an option must be passed to enable the v9
instructions.

   GAS treats sparclite as being compatible with v8, unless an
architecture is explicitly requested.  SPARC v9 is always incompatible
with sparclite.

`-Av6 | -Av7 | -Av8 | -Asparclet | -Asparclite'
`-Av8plus | -Av8plusa | -Av9 | -Av9a'
     Use one of the `-A' options to select one of the SPARC
     architectures explicitly.  If you select an architecture
     explicitly, `as' reports a fatal error if it encounters an
     instruction or feature requiring an incompatible or higher level.

     `-Av8plus' and `-Av8plusa' select a 32 bit environment.

     `-Av9' and `-Av9a' select a 64 bit environment and are not
     available unless GAS is explicitly configured with 64 bit
     environment support.

     `-Av8plusa' and `-Av9a' enable the SPARC V9 instruction set with
     UltraSPARC extensions.

`-xarch=v8plus | -xarch=v8plusa'
     For compatibility with the Solaris v9 assembler.  These options are
     equivalent to -Av8plus and -Av8plusa, respectively.

`-bump'
     Warn whenever it is necessary to switch to another level.  If an
     architecture level is explicitly requested, GAS will not issue
     warnings until that level is reached, and will then bump the level
     as required (except between incompatible levels).

`-32 | -64'
     Select the word size, either 32 bits or 64 bits.  These options
     are only available with the ELF object file format, and require
     that the necessary BFD support has been included.


File: as.info,  Node: Sparc-Aligned-Data,  Next: Sparc-Float,  Prev: Sparc-Opts,  Up: Sparc-Dependent

8.29.2 Enforcing aligned data
-----------------------------

SPARC GAS normally permits data to be misaligned.  For example, it
permits the `.long' pseudo-op to be used on a byte boundary.  However,
the native SunOS and Solaris assemblers issue an error when they see
misaligned data.

   You can use the `--enforce-aligned-data' option to make SPARC GAS
also issue an error about misaligned data, just as the SunOS and Solaris
assemblers do.

   The `--enforce-aligned-data' option is not the default because gcc
issues misaligned data pseudo-ops when it initializes certain packed
data structures (structures defined using the `packed' attribute).  You
may have to assemble with GAS in order to initialize packed data
structures in your own code.

8.29.3 Floating Point
---------------------

The Sparc uses IEEE floating-point numbers.


File: as.info,  Node: Sparc-Directives,  Prev: Sparc-Float,  Up: Sparc-Dependent

8.29.4 Sparc Machine Directives
-------------------------------

The Sparc version of `as' supports the following additional machine
directives:

`.align'
     This must be followed by the desired alignment in bytes.

`.common'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.comm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.half'
     This is functionally identical to `.short'.

`.nword'
     On the Sparc, the `.nword' directive produces native word sized
     value, ie. if assembling with -32 it is equivalent to `.word', if
     assembling with -64 it is equivalent to `.xword'.

`.proc'
     This directive is ignored.  Any text following it on the same line
     is also ignored.

`.register'
     This directive declares use of a global application or system
     register.  It must be followed by a register name %g2, %g3, %g6 or
     %g7, comma and the symbol name for that register.  If symbol name
     is `#scratch', it is a scratch register, if it is `#ignore', it
     just suppresses any errors about using undeclared global register,
     but does not emit any information about it into the object file.
     This can be useful e.g. if you save the register before use and
     restore it after.

`.reserve'
     This must be followed by a symbol name, a positive number, and
     `"bss"'.  This behaves somewhat like `.lcomm', but the syntax is
     different.

`.seg'
     This must be followed by `"text"', `"data"', or `"data1"'.  It
     behaves like `.text', `.data', or `.data 1'.

`.skip'
     This is functionally identical to the `.space' directive.

`.word'
     On the Sparc, the `.word' directive produces 32 bit values,
     instead of the 16 bit values it produces on many other machines.

`.xword'
     On the Sparc V9 processor, the `.xword' directive produces 64 bit
     values.

8.30.1 Options
--------------

The TMS320C54x version of `as' has a few machine-dependent options.

   You can use the `-mfar-mode' option to enable extended addressing
mode.  All addresses will be assumed to be > 16 bits, and the
appropriate relocation types will be used.  This option is equivalent
to using the `.far_mode' directive in the assembly code.  If you do not
use the `-mfar-mode' option, all references will be assumed to be 16
bits.  This option may be abbreviated to `-mf'.

   You can use the `-mcpu' option to specify a particular CPU.  This
option is equivalent to using the `.version' directive in the assembly
code.  For recognized CPU codes, see *Note `.version':
TIC54X-Directives.  The default CPU version is `542'.

   You can use the `-merrors-to-file' option to redirect error output
to a file (this provided for those deficient environments which don't
provide adequate output redirection).  This option may be abbreviated to
`-me'.

formats, using a suffix to indicate the radix:

     Binary                  `000000B, 011000b'
     Octal                   `10Q, 224q'
     Hexadecimal             `45h, 0FH'

8.30.5 String Substitution
--------------------------

A subset of allowable symbols (which we'll call subsyms) may be assigned
arbitrary string values.  This is roughly equivalent to C preprocessor
#define macros.  When `as' encounters one of these symbols, the symbol
is replaced in the input stream by its string value.  Subsym names
*must* begin with a letter.

   Subsyms may be defined using the `.asg' and `.eval' directives
(*Note `.asg': TIC54X-Directives, *Note `.eval': TIC54X-Directives.

   Expansion is recursive until a previously encountered symbol is
seen, at which point substitution stops.

   In this example, x is replaced with SYM2; SYM2 is replaced with
SYM1, and SYM1 is replaced with x.  At this point, x has already been
encountered and the substitution stops.

      .asg   "x",SYM1
      .asg   "SYM1",SYM2
      .asg   "SYM2",x
      add    x,a             ; final code assembled is "add  x, a"

   Macro parameters are converted to subsyms; a side effect of this is
the normal `as' '\ARG' dereferencing syntax is unnecessary.  Subsyms
defined within a macro will have global scope, unless the `.var'
directive is used to identify the subsym as a local macro variable
*note `.var': TIC54X-Directives.

   Substitution may be forced in situations where replacement might be
ambiguous by placing colons on either side of the subsym.  The following
code:

      .eval  "10",x
     LAB:X:  add     #x, a

   When assembled becomes:

     LAB10  add     #10, a

   Smaller parts of the string assigned to a subsym may be accessed with
the following syntax:

``:SYMBOL(CHAR_INDEX):''
     Evaluates to a single-character string, the character at
     CHAR_INDEX.

``:SYMBOL(START,LENGTH):''
     Evaluates to a substring of SYMBOL beginning at START with length
     LENGTH.

8.30.6 Local Labels
-------------------

Local labels may be defined in two ways:

   * $N, where N is a decimal number between 0 and 9

   * LABEL?, where LABEL is any legal symbol name.

   Local labels thus defined may be redefined or automatically
generated.  The scope of a local label is based on when it may be
undefined or reset.  This happens when one of the following situations
is encountered:

   * .newblock directive *note `.newblock': TIC54X-Directives.

   * The current section is changed (.sect, .text, or .data)

   * Entering or leaving an included file

   * The macro scope where the label was defined is exited

8.30.8 Extended Addressing
--------------------------

The `LDX' pseudo-op is provided for loading the extended addressing bits
of a label or address.  For example, if an address `_label' resides in
extended program memory, the value of `_label' may be loaded as follows:
      ldx     #_label,16,a    ; loads extended bits of _label
      or      #_label,a       ; loads lower 16 bits of _label
      bacc    a               ; full address is in accumulator A

8.30.9 Directives
-----------------

`.align [SIZE]'
`.even'
     Align the section program counter on the next boundary, based on
     SIZE.  SIZE may be any power of 2.  `.even' is equivalent to
     `.align' with a SIZE of 2.
    `1'
          Align SPC to word boundary

    `2'
          Align SPC to longword boundary (same as .even)

    `128'
          Align SPC to page boundary

`.asg STRING, NAME'
     Assign NAME the string STRING.  String replacement is performed on
     STRING before assignment.

`.eval STRING, NAME'
     Evaluate the contents of string STRING and assign the result as a
     string to the subsym NAME.  String replacement is performed on
     STRING before assignment.

`.bss SYMBOL, SIZE [, [BLOCKING_FLAG] [,ALIGNMENT_FLAG]]'
     Reserve space for SYMBOL in the .bss section.  SIZE is in words.
     If present, BLOCKING_FLAG indicates the allocated space should be
     aligned on a page boundary if it would otherwise cross a page
     boundary.  If present, ALIGNMENT_FLAG causes the assembler to
     allocate SIZE on a long word boundary.

`.byte VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ubyte VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.char VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uchar VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more bytes into consecutive words of the current
     section.  The upper 8 bits of each word is zero-filled.  If a
     label is used, it points to the word allocated for the first byte
     encountered.

`.clink ["SECTION_NAME"]'
     Set STYP_CLINK flag for this section, which indicates to the
     linker that if no symbols from this section are referenced, the
     section should not be included in the link.  If SECTION_NAME is
     omitted, the current section is used.

`.c_mode'
     TBD.

`.copy "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
`.include "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
     Read source statements from FILENAME.  The normal include search
     path is used.  Normally .copy will cause statements from the
     included file to be printed in the assembly listing and .include
     will not, but this distinction is not currently implemented.

`.data'
     Begin assembling code into the .data section.

`.double VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ldouble VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.float VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.xfloat VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place an IEEE single-precision floating-point representation of
     one or more floating-point values into the current section.  All
     but `.xfloat' align the result on a longword boundary.  Values are
     stored most-significant word first.

`.drlist'
`.drnolist'
     Control printing of directives to the listing file.  Ignored.

`.emsg STRING'
`.mmsg STRING'
`.wmsg STRING'
     Emit a user-defined error, message, or warning, respectively.

`.far_mode'
     Use extended addressing when assembling statements.  This should
     appear only once per file, and is equivalent to the -mfar-mode
     option *note `-mfar-mode': TIC54X-Opts.

`.fclist'
`.fcnolist'
     Control printing of false conditional blocks to the listing file.

`.field VALUE [,SIZE]'
     Initialize a bitfield of SIZE bits in the current section.  If
     VALUE is relocatable, then SIZE must be 16.  SIZE defaults to 16
     bits.  If VALUE does not fit into SIZE bits, the value will be
     truncated.  Successive `.field' directives will pack starting at
     the current word, filling the most significant bits first, and
     aligning to the start of the next word if the field size does not
     fit into the space remaining in the current word.  A `.align'
     directive with an operand of 1 will force the next `.field'
     directive to begin packing into a new word.  If a label is used, it
     points to the word that contains the specified field.

`.global SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
`.def SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
`.ref SYMBOL [,...,SYMBOL_N]'
     `.def' nominally identifies a symbol defined in the current file
     and availalbe to other files.  `.ref' identifies a symbol used in
     the current file but defined elsewhere.  Both map to the standard
     `.global' directive.

`.half VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uhalf VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.short VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ushort VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.int VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uint VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.word VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.uword VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more values into consecutive words of the current
     section.  If a label is used, it points to the word allocated for
     the first value encountered.

`.label SYMBOL'
     Define a special SYMBOL to refer to the load time address of the
     current section program counter.

`.length'
`.width'
     Set the page length and width of the output listing file.  Ignored.

`.list'
`.nolist'
     Control whether the source listing is printed.  Ignored.

`.long VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.ulong VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
`.xlong VALUE [,...,VALUE_N]'
     Place one or more 32-bit values into consecutive words in the
     current section.  The most significant word is stored first.
     `.long' and `.ulong' align the result on a longword boundary;
     `xlong' does not.

`.loop [COUNT]'
`.break [CONDITION]'
`.endloop'
     Repeatedly assemble a block of code.  `.loop' begins the block, and
     `.endloop' marks its termination.  COUNT defaults to 1024, and
     indicates the number of times the block should be repeated.
     `.break' terminates the loop so that assembly begins after the
     `.endloop' directive.  The optional CONDITION will cause the loop
     to terminate only if it evaluates to zero.

`MACRO_NAME .macro [PARAM1][,...PARAM_N]'
`[.mexit]'
`.endm'
     See the section on macros for more explanation (*Note
     TIC54X-Macros::.

`.mlib "FILENAME" | FILENAME'
     Load the macro library FILENAME.  FILENAME must be an archived
     library (BFD ar-compatible) of text files, expected to contain
     only macro definitions.   The standard include search path is used.

`.mlist'

`.mnolist'
     Control whether to include macro and loop block expansions in the
     listing output.  Ignored.

`.mmregs'
     Define global symbolic names for the 'c54x registers.  Supposedly
     equivalent to executing `.set' directives for each register with
     its memory-mapped value, but in reality is provided only for
     compatibility and does nothing.

`.newblock'
     This directive resets any TIC54X local labels currently defined.
     Normal `as' local labels are unaffected.

`.option OPTION_LIST'
     Set listing options.  Ignored.

`.sblock "SECTION_NAME" | SECTION_NAME [,"NAME_N" | NAME_N]'
     Designate SECTION_NAME for blocking.  Blocking guarantees that a
     section will start on a page boundary (128 words) if it would
     otherwise cross a page boundary.  Only initialized sections may be
     designated with this directive.  See also *Note TIC54X-Block::.

`.sect "SECTION_NAME"'
     Define a named initialized section and make it the current section.

`SYMBOL .set "VALUE"'
`SYMBOL .equ "VALUE"'
     Equate a constant VALUE to a SYMBOL, which is placed in the symbol
     table.  SYMBOL may not be previously defined.

`.space SIZE_IN_BITS'
`.bes SIZE_IN_BITS'
     Reserve the given number of bits in the current section and
     zero-fill them.  If a label is used with `.space', it points to the
     *first* word reserved.  With `.bes', the label points to the
     *last* word reserved.

`.sslist'
`.ssnolist'
     Controls the inclusion of subsym replacement in the listing
     output.  Ignored.

`.string "STRING" [,...,"STRING_N"]'
`.pstring "STRING" [,...,"STRING_N"]'
     Place 8-bit characters from STRING into the current section.
     `.string' zero-fills the upper 8 bits of each word, while
     `.pstring' puts two characters into each word, filling the
     most-significant bits first.  Unused space is zero-filled.  If a
     label is used, it points to the first word initialized.

`[STAG] .struct [OFFSET]'
`[NAME_1] element [COUNT_1]'
`[NAME_2] element [COUNT_2]'
`[TNAME] .tag STAGX [TCOUNT]'
`...'
`[NAME_N] element [COUNT_N]'
`[SSIZE] .endstruct'
`LABEL .tag [STAG]'
     Assign symbolic offsets to the elements of a structure.  STAG
     defines a symbol to use to reference the structure.  OFFSET
     indicates a starting value to use for the first element
     encountered; otherwise it defaults to zero.  Each element can have
     a named offset, NAME, which is a symbol assigned the value of the
     element's offset into the structure.  If STAG is missing, these
     become global symbols.  COUNT adjusts the offset that many times,
     as if `element' were an array.  `element' may be one of `.byte',
     `.word', `.long', `.float', or any equivalent of those, and the
     structure offset is adjusted accordingly.  `.field' and `.string'
     are also allowed; the size of `.field' is one bit, and `.string'
     is considered to be one word in size.  Only element descriptors,
     structure/union tags, `.align' and conditional assembly directives
     are allowed within `.struct'/`.endstruct'.  `.align' aligns member
     offsets to word boundaries only.  SSIZE, if provided, will always
     be assigned the size of the structure.

     The `.tag' directive, in addition to being used to define a
     structure/union element within a structure, may be used to apply a
     structure to a symbol.  Once applied to LABEL, the individual
     structure elements may be applied to LABEL to produce the desired
     offsets using LABEL as the structure base.

`.tab'
     Set the tab size in the output listing.  Ignored.

`[UTAG] .union'
`[NAME_1] element [COUNT_1]'
`[NAME_2] element [COUNT_2]'
`[TNAME] .tag UTAGX[,TCOUNT]'
`...'
`[NAME_N] element [COUNT_N]'
`[USIZE] .endstruct'
`LABEL .tag [UTAG]'
     Similar to `.struct', but the offset after each element is reset to
     zero, and the USIZE is set to the maximum of all defined elements.
     Starting offset for the union is always zero.

`[SYMBOL] .usect "SECTION_NAME", SIZE, [,[BLOCKING_FLAG] [,ALIGNMENT_FLAG]]'
     Reserve space for variables in a named, uninitialized section
     (similar to .bss).  `.usect' allows definitions sections
     independent of .bss.  SYMBOL points to the first location reserved
     by this allocation.  The symbol may be used as a variable name.
     SIZE is the allocated size in words.  BLOCKING_FLAG indicates
     whether to block this section on a page boundary (128 words)
     (*note TIC54X-Block::).  ALIGNMENT FLAG indicates whether the
     section should be longword-aligned.

`.var SYM[,..., SYM_N]'
     Define a subsym to be a local variable within a macro.  See *Note
     TIC54X-Macros::.

`.version VERSION'
     Set which processor to build instructions for.  Though the
     following values are accepted, the op is ignored.
    `541'
    `542'
    `543'
    `545'
    `545LP'
    `546LP'
    `548'

8.30.10 Macros
--------------

Macros do not require explicit dereferencing of arguments (i.e. \ARG).

   During macro expansion, the macro parameters are converted to
subsyms.  If the number of arguments passed the macro invocation
exceeds the number of parameters defined, the last parameter is
assigned the string equivalent of all remaining arguments.  If fewer
arguments are given than parameters, the missing parameters are
assigned empty strings.  To include a comma in an argument, you must
enclose the argument in quotes.

   The following built-in subsym functions allow examination of the
string value of subsyms (or ordinary strings).  The arguments are
strings unless otherwise indicated (subsyms passed as args will be
replaced by the strings they represent).
``$symlen(STR)''
     Returns the length of STR.

``$symcmp(STR1,STR2)''
     Returns 0 if STR1 == STR2, non-zero otherwise.

``$firstch(STR,CH)''
     Returns index of the first occurrence of character constant CH in
     STR.

``$lastch(STR,CH)''
     Returns index of the last occurrence of character constant CH in
     STR.

``$isdefed(SYMBOL)''
     Returns zero if the symbol SYMBOL is not in the symbol table,
     non-zero otherwise.

``$ismember(SYMBOL,LIST)''
     Assign the first member of comma-separated string LIST to SYMBOL;
     LIST is reassigned the remainder of the list.  Returns zero if
     LIST is a null string.  Both arguments must be subsyms.

``$iscons(EXPR)''
     Returns 1 if string EXPR is binary, 2 if octal, 3 if hexadecimal,
     4 if a character, 5 if decimal, and zero if not an integer.

``$isname(NAME)''
     Returns 1 if NAME is a valid symbol name, zero otherwise.

``$isreg(REG)''
     Returns 1 if REG is a valid predefined register name (AR0-AR7
     only).

``$structsz(STAG)''
     Returns the size of the structure or union represented by STAG.

``$structacc(STAG)''
     Returns the reference point of the structure or union represented
     by STAG.   Always returns zero.

8.31 Z8000 Dependent Features
=============================

   The Z8000 as supports both members of the Z8000 family: the
unsegmented Z8002, with 16 bit addresses, and the segmented Z8001 with
24 bit addresses.

   When the assembler is in unsegmented mode (specified with the
`unsegm' directive), an address takes up one word (16 bit) sized
register.  When the assembler is in segmented mode (specified with the
`segm' directive), a 24-bit address takes up a long (32 bit) register.

8.31.2.3 Addressing Modes
.........................

as understands the following addressing modes for the Z8000:

`rlN'
`rhN'
`rN'
`rrN'
`rqN'
     Register direct:  8bit, 16bit, 32bit, and 64bit registers.

`@@rN'
`@@rrN'
     Indirect register:  @@rrN in segmented mode, @@rN in unsegmented
     mode.

`ADDR'
     Direct: the 16 bit or 24 bit address (depending on whether the
     assembler is in segmented or unsegmented mode) of the operand is
     in the instruction.

`address(rN)'
     Indexed: the 16 or 24 bit address is added to the 16 bit register
     to produce the final address in memory of the operand.

`rN(#IMM)'
`rrN(#IMM)'
     Base Address: the 16 or 24 bit register is added to the 16 bit sign
     extended immediate displacement to produce the final address in
     memory of the operand.

`rN(rM)'
`rrN(rM)'
     Base Index: the 16 or 24 bit register rN or rrN is added to the
     sign extended 16 bit index register rM to produce the final
     address in memory of the operand.

`#XX'
     Immediate data XX.

8.31.3 Assembler Directives for the Z8000
-----------------------------------------

The Z8000 port of as includes additional assembler directives, for
compatibility with other Z8000 assemblers.  These do not begin with `.'
(unlike the ordinary as directives).

`segm'
`.z8001'
     Generate code for the segmented Z8001.

`unsegm'
`.z8002'
     Generate code for the unsegmented Z8002.

`name'
     Synonym for `.file'

`global'
     Synonym for `.global'

`wval'
     Synonym for `.word'

`lval'
     Synonym for `.long'

`bval'
     Synonym for `.byte'

`sval'
     Assemble a string.  `sval' expects one string literal, delimited by
     single quotes.  It assembles each byte of the string into
     consecutive addresses.  You can use the escape sequence `%XX'
     (where XX represents a two-digit hexadecimal number) to represent
     the character whose ASCII value is XX.  Use this feature to
     describe single quote and other characters that may not appear in
     string literals as themselves.  For example, the C statement
     `char *a = "he said \"it's 50% off\"";' is represented in Z8000
     assembly language (shown with the assembler output in hex at the
     left) as

          68652073    sval    'he said %22it%27s 50%25 off%22%00'
          61696420
          22697427
          73203530
          25206F66
          662200

`rsect'
     synonym for `.section'

`block'
     synonym for `.space'

`even'
     special case of `.align'; aligns output to even byte boundary.

8.32.1 VAX Command-Line Options
-------------------------------

The Vax version of `as' accepts any of the following options, gives a
warning message that the option was ignored and proceeds.  These
options are for compatibility with scripts designed for other people's
assemblers.

``-D' (Debug)'
``-S' (Symbol Table)'
``-T' (Token Trace)'
     These are obsolete options used to debug old assemblers.

``-d' (Displacement size for JUMPs)'
     This option expects a number following the `-d'.  Like options
     that expect filenames, the number may immediately follow the `-d'
     (old standard) or constitute the whole of the command line
     argument that follows `-d' (GNU standard).

``-V' (Virtualize Interpass Temporary File)'
     Some other assemblers use a temporary file.  This option commanded
     them to keep the information in active memory rather than in a
     disk file.  `as' always does this, so this option is redundant.

``-J' (JUMPify Longer Branches)'
     Many 32-bit computers permit a variety of branch instructions to
     do the same job.  Some of these instructions are short (and fast)
     but have a limited range; others are long (and slow) but can
     branch anywhere in virtual memory.  Often there are 3 flavors of
     branch: short, medium and long.  Some other assemblers would emit
     short and medium branches, unless told by this option to emit
     short and long branches.

``-t' (Temporary File Directory)'
     Some other assemblers may use a temporary file, and this option
     takes a filename being the directory to site the temporary file.
     Since `as' does not use a temporary disk file, this option makes
     no difference.  `-t' needs exactly one filename.

   The Vax version of the assembler accepts additional options when
compiled for VMS:

`-h N'
     External symbol or section (used for global variables) names are
     not case sensitive on VAX/VMS and always mapped to upper case.
     This is contrary to the C language definition which explicitly
     distinguishes upper and lower case.  To implement a standard
     conforming C compiler, names must be changed (mapped) to preserve
     the case information.  The default mapping is to convert all lower
     case characters to uppercase and adding an underscore followed by
     a 6 digit hex value, representing a 24 digit binary value.  The
     one digits in the binary value represent which characters are
     uppercase in the original symbol name.

     The `-h N' option determines how we map names.  This takes several
     values.  No `-h' switch at all allows case hacking as described
     above.  A value of zero (`-h0') implies names should be upper
     case, and inhibits the case hack.  A value of 2 (`-h2') implies
     names should be all lower case, with no case hack.  A value of 3
     (`-h3') implies that case should be preserved.  The value 1 is
     unused.  The `-H' option directs `as' to display every mapped
     symbol during assembly.

     Symbols whose names include a dollar sign `$' are exceptions to the
     general name mapping.  These symbols are normally only used to
     reference VMS library names.  Such symbols are always mapped to
     upper case.

`-+'
     The `-+' option causes `as' to truncate any symbol name larger
     than 31 characters.  The `-+' option also prevents some code
     following the `_main' symbol normally added to make the object
     file compatible with Vax-11 "C".

`-1'
     This option is ignored for backward compatibility with `as'
     version 1.x.

`-H'
     The `-H' option causes `as' to print every symbol which was
     changed by case mapping.

8.32.2 VAX Floating Point
-------------------------

Conversion of flonums to floating point is correct, and compatible with
previous assemblers.  Rounding is towards zero if the remainder is
exactly half the least significant bit.

   `D', `F', `G' and `H' floating point formats are understood.

   Immediate floating literals (_e.g._ `S`$6.9') are rendered
correctly.  Again, rounding is towards zero in the boundary case.

   The `.float' directive produces `f' format numbers.  The `.double'
directive produces `d' format numbers.

8.32.3 Vax Machine Directives
-----------------------------

The Vax version of the assembler supports four directives for
generating Vax floating point constants.  They are described in the
table below.

`.dfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `d' format 64-bit floating point constants.

`.ffloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `f' format 32-bit floating point constants.

`.gfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `g' format 64-bit floating point constants.

`.hfloat'
     This expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas, and
     assembles Vax `h' format 128-bit floating point constants.

8.32.4 VAX Opcodes
------------------

All DEC mnemonics are supported.  Beware that `case...' instructions
have exactly 3 operands.  The dispatch table that follows the `case...'
instruction should be made with `.word' statements.  This is compatible
with all unix assemblers we know of.

8.32.5 VAX Branch Improvement
-----------------------------

Certain pseudo opcodes are permitted.  They are for branch
instructions.  They expand to the shortest branch instruction that
reaches the target.  Generally these mnemonics are made by substituting
`j' for `b' at the start of a DEC mnemonic.  This feature is included
both for compatibility and to help compilers.  If you do not need this
feature, avoid these opcodes.  Here are the mnemonics, and the code
they can expand into.

`jbsb'
     `Jsb' is already an instruction mnemonic, so we chose `jbsb'.
    (byte displacement)
          `bsbb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bsbw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jsb ...'

`jbr'
`jr'
     Unconditional branch.
    (byte displacement)
          `brb ...'

    (word displacement)
          `brw ...'

    (long displacement)
          `jmp ...'

`jCOND'
     COND may be any one of the conditional branches `neq', `nequ',
     `eql', `eqlu', `gtr', `geq', `lss', `gtru', `lequ', `vc', `vs',
     `gequ', `cc', `lssu', `cs'.  COND may also be one of the bit tests
     `bs', `bc', `bss', `bcs', `bsc', `bcc', `bssi', `bcci', `lbs',
     `lbc'.  NOTCOND is the opposite condition to COND.
    (byte displacement)
          `bCOND ...'

    (word displacement)
          `bNOTCOND foo ; brw ... ; foo:'

    (long displacement)
          `bNOTCOND foo ; jmp ... ; foo:'

`jacbX'
     X may be one of `b d f g h l w'.
    (word displacement)
          `OPCODE ...'

    (long displacement)
               OPCODE ..., foo ;
               brb bar ;
               foo: jmp ... ;
               bar:

`jaobYYY'
     YYY may be one of `lss leq'.

`jsobZZZ'
     ZZZ may be one of `geq gtr'.
    (byte displacement)
          `OPCODE ...'

    (word displacement)
               OPCODE ..., foo ;
               brb bar ;
               foo: brw DESTINATION ;

8.32.6 VAX Operands
-------------------

The immediate character is `$' for Unix compatibility, not `#' as DEC
writes it.

   The indirect character is `*' for Unix compatibility, not `@@' as DEC
writes it.

   The displacement sizing character is ``' (an accent grave) for Unix
compatibility, not `^' as DEC writes it.  The letter preceding ``' may
have either case.  `G' is not understood, but all other letters (`b i l
s w') are understood.

   Register names understood are `r0 r1 r2 ... r15 ap fp sp pc'.  Upper
and lower case letters are equivalent.

   For instance
     tstb *w`$4(r5)

   Any expression is permitted in an operand.  Operands are comma
separated.

8.33.1 Options
--------------

`as' supports the following additional command-line options for the
V850 processor family:

`-wsigned_overflow'
     Causes warnings to be produced when signed immediate values
     overflow the space available for then within their opcodes.  By
     default this option is disabled as it is possible to receive
     spurious warnings due to using exact bit patterns as immediate
     constants.

`-wunsigned_overflow'
     Causes warnings to be produced when unsigned immediate values
     overflow the space available for then within their opcodes.  By
     default this option is disabled as it is possible to receive
     spurious warnings due to using exact bit patterns as immediate
     constants.

`-mv850'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850e'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E processor.  This allows the linker to detect
     attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850e1'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850E1 processor.  This allows the linker to
     detect attempts to link such code with code assembled for other
     processors.

`-mv850any'
     Specifies that the assembled code should be marked as being
     targeted at the V850 processor but support instructions that are
     specific to the extended variants of the process.  This allows the
     production of binaries that contain target specific code, but
     which are also intended to be used in a generic fashion.  For
     example libgcc.a contains generic routines used by the code
     produced by GCC for all versions of the v850 architecture,
     together with support routines only used by the V850E architecture.

`-mrelax'
     Enables relaxation.  This allows the .longcall and .longjump pseudo
     ops to be used in the assembler source code.  These ops label
     sections of code which are either a long function call or a long
     branch.  The assembler will then flag these sections of code and
     the linker will attempt to relax them.

8.33.5 Opcodes
--------------

`as' implements all the standard V850 opcodes.

   `as' also implements the following pseudo ops:

`hi0()'
     Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `mulhi hi0(here - there), r5, r6'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the upper 16 bits of this difference, shifts it
     down 16 bits and then mutliplies it by the lower 16 bits in
     register 5, putting the result into register 6.

`lo()'
     Computes the lower 16 bits of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For
     example:

     `addi lo(here - there), r5, r6'

     computes the difference between the address of labels 'here' and
     'there', takes the lower 16 bits of this difference and adds it to
     register 5, putting the result into register 6.

`hi()'
     Computes the higher 16 bits of the given expression and then adds
     the value of the most significant bit of the lower 16 bits of the
     expression and stores the result into the immediate operand field
     of the given instruction.  For example the following code can be
     used to compute the address of the label 'here' and store it into
     register 6:

     `movhi hi(here), r0, r6'     `movea lo(here), r6, r6'

     The reason for this special behaviour is that movea performs a sign
     extension on its immediate operand.  So for example if the address
     of 'here' was 0xFFFFFFFF then without the special behaviour of the
     hi() pseudo-op the movhi instruction would put 0xFFFF0000 into r6,
     then the movea instruction would takes its immediate operand,
     0xFFFF, sign extend it to 32 bits, 0xFFFFFFFF, and then add it
     into r6 giving 0xFFFEFFFF which is wrong (the fifth nibble is E).
     With the hi() pseudo op adding in the top bit of the lo() pseudo
     op, the movhi instruction actually stores 0 into r6 (0xFFFF + 1 =
     0x0000), so that the movea instruction stores 0xFFFFFFFF into r6 -
     the right value.

`hilo()'
     Computes the 32 bit value of the given expression and stores it
     into the immediate operand field of the given instruction (which
     must be a mov instruction).  For example:

     `mov hilo(here), r6'

     computes the absolute address of label 'here' and puts the result
     into register 6.

`sdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Small Data Area (whoes address is held in register 4, the GP
     register) and stores the result as a 16 bit signed value in the
     immediate operand field of the given instruction.  For example:

     `ld.w sdaoff(_a_variable)[gp],r6'

     loads the contents of the location pointed to by the label
     '_a_variable' into register 6, provided that the label is located
     somewhere within +/- 32K of the address held in the GP register.
     [Note the linker assumes that the GP register contains a fixed
     address set to the address of the label called '__gp'.  This can
     either be set up automatically by the linker, or specifically set
     by using the `--defsym __gp=<value>' command line option].

`tdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Tiny Data Area (whoes address is held in register 30, the EP
     register) and stores the result as a 4,5, 7 or 8 bit unsigned
     value in the immediate operand field of the given instruction.
     For example:

     `sld.w tdaoff(_a_variable)[ep],r6'

     loads the contents of the location pointed to by the label
     '_a_variable' into register 6, provided that the label is located
     somewhere within +256 bytes of the address held in the EP
     register.  [Note the linker assumes that the EP register contains
     a fixed address set to the address of the label called '__ep'.
     This can either be set up automatically by the linker, or
     specifically set by using the `--defsym __ep=<value>' command line
     option].

`zdaoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from address 0 and
     stores the result as a 16 bit signed value in the immediate
     operand field of the given instruction.  For example:

     `movea zdaoff(_a_variable),zero,r6'

     puts the address of the label '_a_variable' into register 6,
     assuming that the label is somewhere within the first 32K of
     memory.  (Strictly speaking it also possible to access the last
     32K of memory as well, as the offsets are signed).

`ctoff()'
     Computes the offset of the named variable from the start of the
     Call Table Area (whoes address is helg in system register 20, the
     CTBP register) and stores the result a 6 or 16 bit unsigned value
     in the immediate field of then given instruction or piece of data.
     For example:

     `callt ctoff(table_func1)'

     will put the call the function whoes address is held in the call
     table at the location labeled 'table_func1'.

`.longcall `name''
     Indicates that the following sequence of instructions is a long
     call to function `name'.  The linker will attempt to shorten this
     call sequence if `name' is within a 22bit offset of the call.  Only
     valid if the `-mrelax' command line switch has been enabled.

`.longjump `name''
     Indicates that the following sequence of instructions is a long
     jump to label `name'.  The linker will attempt to shorten this code
     sequence if `name' is within a 22bit offset of the jump.  Only
     valid if the `-mrelax' command line switch has been enabled.

8.34.1 Command Line Options
---------------------------

The Xtensa version of the GNU assembler supports these special options:

`--text-section-literals | --no-text-section-literals'
     Control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
     `--no-text-section-literals', which places literals in a separate
     section in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be
     placed in a data RAM/ROM.  With `--text-section-literals', the
     literals are interspersed in the text section in order to keep
     them as close as possible to their references.  This may be
     necessary for large assembly files, where the literals would
     otherwise be out of range of the `L32R' instructions in the text
     section.  These options only affect literals referenced via
     PC-relative `L32R' instructions; literals for absolute mode `L32R'
     instructions are handled separately.

`--absolute-literals | --no-absolute-literals'
     Indicate to the assembler whether `L32R' instructions use absolute
     or PC-relative addressing.  If the processor includes the absolute
     addressing option, the default is to use absolute `L32R'
     relocations.  Otherwise, only the PC-relative `L32R' relocations
     can be used.

`--target-align | --no-target-align'
     Enable or disable automatic alignment to reduce branch penalties
     at some expense in code size.  *Note Automatic Instruction
     Alignment: Xtensa Automatic Alignment.  This optimization is
     enabled by default.  Note that the assembler will always align
     instructions like `LOOP' that have fixed alignment requirements.

`--longcalls | --no-longcalls'
     Enable or disable transformation of call instructions to allow
     calls across a greater range of addresses.  *Note Function Call
     Relaxation: Xtensa Call Relaxation.  This option should be used
     when call targets can potentially be out of range.  It may degrade
     both code size and performance, but the linker can generally
     optimize away the unnecessary overhead when a call ends up within
     range.  The default is `--no-longcalls'.

`--transform | --no-transform'
     Enable or disable all assembler transformations of Xtensa
     instructions, including both relaxation and optimization.  The
     default is `--transform'; `--no-transform' should only be used in
     the rare cases when the instructions must be exactly as specified
     in the assembly source.  Using `--no-transform' causes out of range
     instruction operands to be errors.

`--rename-section OLDNAME=NEWNAME'
     Rename the OLDNAME section to NEWNAME.  This option can be used
     multiple times to rename multiple sections.

8.34.2 Assembler Syntax
-----------------------

Block comments are delimited by `/*' and `*/'.  End of line comments
may be introduced with either `#' or `//'.

   Instructions consist of a leading opcode or macro name followed by
whitespace and an optional comma-separated list of operands:

     OPCODE [OPERAND, ...]

   Instructions must be separated by a newline or semicolon.

   FLIX instructions, which bundle multiple opcodes together in a single
instruction, are specified by enclosing the bundled opcodes inside
braces:

     {
     [FORMAT]
     OPCODE0 [OPERANDS]
     OPCODE1 [OPERANDS]
     OPCODE2 [OPERANDS]
     ...
     }

   The opcodes in a FLIX instruction are listed in the same order as the
corresponding instruction slots in the TIE format declaration.
Directives and labels are not allowed inside the braces of a FLIX
instruction.  A particular TIE format name can optionally be specified
immediately after the opening brace, but this is usually unnecessary.
The assembler will automatically search for a format that can encode the
specified opcodes, so the format name need only be specified in rare
cases where there is more than one applicable format and where it
matters which of those formats is used.  A FLIX instruction can also be
specified on a single line by separating the opcodes with semicolons:

     { [FORMAT;] OPCODE0 [OPERANDS]; OPCODE1 [OPERANDS]; OPCODE2 [OPERANDS]; ... }

   The assembler can automatically bundle opcodes into FLIX
instructions.  It encodes the opcodes in order, one at a time, choosing
the smallest format where each opcode can be encoded and filling unused
instruction slots with no-ops.

8.34.2.1 Opcode Names
.....................

See the `Xtensa Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Reference Manual'
for a complete list of opcodes and descriptions of their semantics.

   If an opcode name is prefixed with an underscore character (`_'),
`as' will not transform that instruction in any way.  The underscore
prefix disables both optimization (*note Xtensa Optimizations: Xtensa
Optimizations.) and relaxation (*note Xtensa Relaxation: Xtensa
Relaxation.) for that particular instruction.  Only use the underscore
prefix when it is essential to select the exact opcode produced by the
assembler.  Using this feature unnecessarily makes the code less
efficient by disabling assembler optimization and less flexible by
disabling relaxation.

   Note that this special handling of underscore prefixes only applies
to Xtensa opcodes, not to either built-in macros or user-defined macros.
When an underscore prefix is used with a macro (e.g., `_MOV'), it
refers to a different macro.  The assembler generally provides built-in
macros both with and without the underscore prefix, where the underscore
versions behave as if the underscore carries through to the instructions
in the macros.  For example, `_MOV' may expand to `_MOV.N'.

   The underscore prefix only applies to individual instructions, not to
series of instructions.  For example, if a series of instructions have
underscore prefixes, the assembler will not transform the individual
instructions, but it may insert other instructions between them (e.g.,
to align a `LOOP' instruction).  To prevent the assembler from
modifying a series of instructions as a whole, use the `no-transform'
directive.  *Note transform: Transform Directive.

8.34.2.2 Register Names
.......................

The assembly syntax for a register file entry is the "short" name for a
TIE register file followed by the index into that register file.  For
example, the general-purpose `AR' register file has a short name of
`a', so these registers are named `a0'...`a15'.  As a special feature,
`sp' is also supported as a synonym for `a1'.  Additional registers may
be added by processor configuration options and by designer-defined TIE
extensions.  An initial `$' character is optional in all register names.

8.34.3 Xtensa Optimizations
---------------------------

The optimizations currently supported by `as' are generation of density
instructions where appropriate and automatic branch target alignment.

* Menu:

* Density Instructions::        Using Density Instructions.
* Xtensa Automatic Alignment::  Automatic Instruction Alignment.


File: as.info,  Node: Density Instructions,  Next: Xtensa Automatic Alignment,  Up: Xtensa Optimizations

8.34.3.1 Using Density Instructions
...................................

The Xtensa instruction set has a code density option that provides
16-bit versions of some of the most commonly used opcodes.  Use of these
opcodes can significantly reduce code size.  When possible, the
assembler automatically translates instructions from the core Xtensa
instruction set into equivalent instructions from the Xtensa code
density option.  This translation can be disabled by using underscore
prefixes (*note Opcode Names: Xtensa Opcodes.), by using the
`--no-transform' command-line option (*note Command Line Options:
Xtensa Options.), or by using the `no-transform' directive (*note
transform: Transform Directive.).

   It is a good idea _not_ to use the density instructions directly.
The assembler will automatically select dense instructions where
possible.  If you later need to use an Xtensa processor without the code
density option, the same assembly code will then work without
modification.


File: as.info,  Node: Xtensa Automatic Alignment,  Prev: Density Instructions,  Up: Xtensa Optimizations

8.34.3.2 Automatic Instruction Alignment
........................................

The Xtensa assembler will automatically align certain instructions, both
to optimize performance and to satisfy architectural requirements.

   As an optimization to improve performance, the assembler attempts to
align branch targets so they do not cross instruction fetch boundaries.
(Xtensa processors can be configured with either 32-bit or 64-bit
instruction fetch widths.)  An instruction immediately following a call
is treated as a branch target in this context, because it will be the
target of a return from the call.  This alignment has the potential to
reduce branch penalties at some expense in code size.  The assembler
will not attempt to align labels with the prefixes `.Ln' and `.LM',
since these labels are used for debugging information and are not
typically branch targets.  This optimization is enabled by default.
You can disable it with the `--no-target-align' command-line option
(*note Command Line Options: Xtensa Options.).

   The target alignment optimization is done without adding instructions
that could increase the execution time of the program.  If there are
density instructions in the code preceding a target, the assembler can
change the target alignment by widening some of those instructions to
the equivalent 24-bit instructions.  Extra bytes of padding can be
inserted immediately following unconditional jump and return
instructions.  This approach is usually successful in aligning many,
but not all, branch targets.

   The `LOOP' family of instructions must be aligned such that the
first instruction in the loop body does not cross an instruction fetch
boundary (e.g., with a 32-bit fetch width, a `LOOP' instruction must be
on either a 1 or 2 mod 4 byte boundary).  The assembler knows about
this restriction and inserts the minimal number of 2 or 3 byte no-op
instructions to satisfy it.  When no-op instructions are added, any
label immediately preceding the original loop will be moved in order to
refer to the loop instruction, not the newly generated no-op
instruction.  To preserve binary compatibility across processors with
different fetch widths, the assembler conservatively assumes a 32-bit
fetch width when aligning `LOOP' instructions (except if the first
instruction in the loop is a 64-bit instruction).

   Similarly, the `ENTRY' instruction must be aligned on a 0 mod 4 byte
boundary.  The assembler satisfies this requirement by inserting zero
bytes when required.  In addition, labels immediately preceding the
`ENTRY' instruction will be moved to the newly aligned instruction
location.

8.34.4 Xtensa Relaxation
------------------------

When an instruction operand is outside the range allowed for that
particular instruction field, `as' can transform the code to use a
functionally-equivalent instruction or sequence of instructions.  This
process is known as "relaxation".  This is typically done for branch
instructions because the distance of the branch targets is not known
until assembly-time.  The Xtensa assembler offers branch relaxation and
also extends this concept to function calls, `MOVI' instructions and
other instructions with immediate fields.

* Menu:

* Xtensa Branch Relaxation::        Relaxation of Branches.
* Xtensa Call Relaxation::          Relaxation of Function Calls.
* Xtensa Immediate Relaxation::     Relaxation of other Immediate Fields.

8.34.4.1 Conditional Branch Relaxation
......................................

When the target of a branch is too far away from the branch itself,
i.e., when the offset from the branch to the target is too large to fit
in the immediate field of the branch instruction, it may be necessary to
replace the branch with a branch around a jump.  For example,

         beqz    a2, L

   may result in:

         bnez.n  a2, M
         j L
     M:

   (The `BNEZ.N' instruction would be used in this example only if the
density option is available.  Otherwise, `BNEZ' would be used.)

   This relaxation works well because the unconditional jump instruction
has a much larger offset range than the various conditional branches.
However, an error will occur if a branch target is beyond the range of a
jump instruction.  `as' cannot relax unconditional jumps.  Similarly,
an error will occur if the original input contains an unconditional
jump to a target that is out of range.

   Branch relaxation is enabled by default.  It can be disabled by using
underscore prefixes (*note Opcode Names: Xtensa Opcodes.), the
`--no-transform' command-line option (*note Command Line Options:
Xtensa Options.), or the `no-transform' directive (*note transform:
Transform Directive.).


File: as.info,  Node: Xtensa Call Relaxation,  Next: Xtensa Immediate Relaxation,  Prev: Xtensa Branch Relaxation,  Up: Xtensa Relaxation

8.34.4.2 Function Call Relaxation
.................................

Function calls may require relaxation because the Xtensa immediate call
instructions (`CALL0', `CALL4', `CALL8' and `CALL12') provide a
PC-relative offset of only 512 Kbytes in either direction.  For larger
programs, it may be necessary to use indirect calls (`CALLX0',
`CALLX4', `CALLX8' and `CALLX12') where the target address is specified
in a register.  The Xtensa assembler can automatically relax immediate
call instructions into indirect call instructions.  This relaxation is
done by loading the address of the called function into the callee's
return address register and then using a `CALLX' instruction.  So, for
example:

         call8 func

   might be relaxed to:

         .literal .L1, func
         l32r    a8, .L1
         callx8  a8

   Because the addresses of targets of function calls are not generally
known until link-time, the assembler must assume the worst and relax all
the calls to functions in other source files, not just those that really
will be out of range.  The linker can recognize calls that were
unnecessarily relaxed, and it will remove the overhead introduced by the
assembler for those cases where direct calls are sufficient.

   Call relaxation is disabled by default because it can have a negative
effect on both code size and performance, although the linker can
usually eliminate the unnecessary overhead.  If a program is too large
and some of the calls are out of range, function call relaxation can be
enabled using the `--longcalls' command-line option or the `longcalls'
directive (*note longcalls: Longcalls Directive.).


File: as.info,  Node: Xtensa Immediate Relaxation,  Prev: Xtensa Call Relaxation,  Up: Xtensa Relaxation

8.34.4.3 Other Immediate Field Relaxation
.........................................

The assembler normally performs the following other relaxations.  They
can be disabled by using underscore prefixes (*note Opcode Names:
Xtensa Opcodes.), the `--no-transform' command-line option (*note
Command Line Options: Xtensa Options.), or the `no-transform' directive
(*note transform: Transform Directive.).

   The `MOVI' machine instruction can only materialize values in the
range from -2048 to 2047.  Values outside this range are best
materialized with `L32R' instructions.  Thus:

         movi a0, 100000

   is assembled into the following machine code:

         .literal .L1, 100000
         l32r a0, .L1

   The `L8UI' machine instruction can only be used with immediate
offsets in the range from 0 to 255. The `L16SI' and `L16UI' machine
instructions can only be used with offsets from 0 to 510.  The `L32I'
machine instruction can only be used with offsets from 0 to 1020.  A
load offset outside these ranges can be materalized with an `L32R'
instruction if the destination register of the load is different than
the source address register.  For example:

         l32i a1, a0, 2040

   is translated to:

         .literal .L1, 2040
         l32r a1, .L1
         addi a1, a0, a1
         l32i a1, a1, 0

If the load destination and source address register are the same, an
out-of-range offset causes an error.

   The Xtensa `ADDI' instruction only allows immediate operands in the
range from -128 to 127.  There are a number of alternate instruction
sequences for the `ADDI' operation.  First, if the immediate is 0, the
`ADDI' will be turned into a `MOV.N' instruction (or the equivalent
`OR' instruction if the code density option is not available).  If the
`ADDI' immediate is outside of the range -128 to 127, but inside the
range -32896 to 32639, an `ADDMI' instruction or `ADDMI'/`ADDI'
sequence will be used.  Finally, if the immediate is outside of this
range and a free register is available, an `L32R'/`ADD' sequence will
be used with a literal allocated from the literal pool.

   For example:

         addi    a5, a6, 0
         addi    a5, a6, 512
         addi    a5, a6, 513
         addi    a5, a6, 50000

   is assembled into the following:

         .literal .L1, 50000
         mov.n   a5, a6
         addmi   a5, a6, 0x200
         addmi   a5, a6, 0x200
         addi    a5, a5, 1
         l32r    a5, .L1
         add     a5, a6, a5

8.34.5 Directives
-----------------

The Xtensa assember supports a region-based directive syntax:

         .begin DIRECTIVE [OPTIONS]
         ...
         .end DIRECTIVE

   All the Xtensa-specific directives that apply to a region of code use
this syntax.

   The directive applies to code between the `.begin' and the `.end'.
The state of the option after the `.end' reverts to what it was before
the `.begin'.  A nested `.begin'/`.end' region can further change the
state of the directive without having to be aware of its outer state.
For example, consider:

         .begin no-transform
     L:  add a0, a1, a2
         .begin transform
     M:  add a0, a1, a2
         .end transform
     N:  add a0, a1, a2
         .end no-transform

   The `ADD' opcodes at `L' and `N' in the outer `no-transform' region
both result in `ADD' machine instructions, but the assembler selects an
`ADD.N' instruction for the `ADD' at `M' in the inner `transform'
region.

   The advantage of this style is that it works well inside macros
which can preserve the context of their callers.

   The following directives are available:

* Menu:

* Schedule Directive::         Enable instruction scheduling.
* Longcalls Directive::        Use Indirect Calls for Greater Range.
* Transform Directive::        Disable All Assembler Transformations.
* Literal Directive::          Intermix Literals with Instructions.
* Literal Position Directive:: Specify Inline Literal Pool Locations.
* Literal Prefix Directive::   Specify Literal Section Name Prefix.
* Absolute Literals Directive:: Control PC-Relative vs. Absolute Literals.

8.34.5.1 schedule
.................

The `schedule' directive is recognized only for compatibility with
Tensilica's assembler.

         .begin [no-]schedule
         .end [no-]schedule

8.34.5.2 longcalls
..................

The `longcalls' directive enables or disables function call relaxation.
*Note Function Call Relaxation: Xtensa Call Relaxation.

         .begin [no-]longcalls
         .end [no-]longcalls

   Call relaxation is disabled by default unless the `--longcalls'
command-line option is specified.  The `longcalls' directive overrides
the default determined by the command-line options.

8.34.5.3 transform
..................

This directive enables or disables all assembler transformation,
including relaxation (*note Xtensa Relaxation: Xtensa Relaxation.) and
optimization (*note Xtensa Optimizations: Xtensa Optimizations.).

         .begin [no-]transform
         .end [no-]transform

   Transformations are enabled by default unless the `--no-transform'
option is used.  The `transform' directive overrides the default
determined by the command-line options.  An underscore opcode prefix,
disabling transformation of that opcode, always takes precedence over
both directives and command-line flags.


File: as.info,  Node: Literal Directive,  Next: Literal Position Directive,  Prev: Transform Directive,  Up: Xtensa Directives

8.34.5.4 literal
................

The `.literal' directive is used to define literal pool data, i.e.,
read-only 32-bit data accessed via `L32R' instructions.

         .literal LABEL, VALUE[, VALUE...]

   This directive is similar to the standard `.word' directive, except
that the actual location of the literal data is determined by the
assembler and linker, not by the position of the `.literal' directive.
Using this directive gives the assembler freedom to locate the literal
data in the most appropriate place and possibly to combine identical
literals.  For example, the code:

         entry sp, 40
         .literal .L1, sym
         l32r    a4, .L1

   can be used to load a pointer to the symbol `sym' into register
`a4'.  The value of `sym' will not be placed between the `ENTRY' and
`L32R' instructions; instead, the assembler puts the data in a literal
pool.

   Literal pools for absolute mode `L32R' instructions (*note Absolute
Literals Directive::) are placed in a seperate `.lit4' section.  By
default literal pools for PC-relative mode `L32R' instructions are
placed in a separate `.literal' section; however, when using the
`--text-section-literals' option (*note Command Line Options: Xtensa
Options.), the literal pools are placed in the current section.  These
text section literal pools are created automatically before `ENTRY'
instructions and manually after `.literal_position' directives (*note
literal_position: Literal Position Directive.).  If there are no
preceding `ENTRY' instructions, explicit `.literal_position' directives
must be used to place the text section literal pools; otherwise, `as'
will report an error.


File: as.info,  Node: Literal Position Directive,  Next: Literal Prefix Directive,  Prev: Literal Directive,  Up: Xtensa Directives

8.34.5.5 literal_position
.........................

When using `--text-section-literals' to place literals inline in the
section being assembled, the `.literal_position' directive can be used
to mark a potential location for a literal pool.

         .literal_position

   The `.literal_position' directive is ignored when the
`--text-section-literals' option is not used or when `L32R'
instructions use the absolute addressing mode.

   The assembler will automatically place text section literal pools
before `ENTRY' instructions, so the `.literal_position' directive is
only needed to specify some other location for a literal pool.  You may
need to add an explicit jump instruction to skip over an inline literal
pool.

   For example, an interrupt vector does not begin with an `ENTRY'
instruction so the assembler will be unable to automatically find a good
place to put a literal pool.  Moreover, the code for the interrupt
vector must be at a specific starting address, so the literal pool
cannot come before the start of the code.  The literal pool for the
vector must be explicitly positioned in the middle of the vector (before
any uses of the literals, due to the negative offsets used by
PC-relative `L32R' instructions).  The `.literal_position' directive
can be used to do this.  In the following code, the literal for `M'
will automatically be aligned correctly and is placed after the
unconditional jump.

         .global M
     code_start:
         j continue
         .literal_position
         .align 4
     continue:
         movi    a4, M


File: as.info,  Node: Literal Prefix Directive,  Next: Absolute Literals Directive,  Prev: Literal Position Directive,  Up: Xtensa Directives

8.34.5.6 literal_prefix
.......................

The `literal_prefix' directive allows you to specify different sections
to hold literals from different portions of an assembly file.  With
this directive, a single assembly file can be used to generate code
into multiple sections, including literals generated by the assembler.

         .begin literal_prefix [NAME]
         .end literal_prefix

   By default the assembler places literal pools in sections separate
from the instructions, using the default literal section names of
`.literal' for PC-relative mode `L32R' instructions and `.lit4' for
absolute mode `L32R' instructions (*note Absolute Literals
Directive::).  The `literal_prefix' directive causes different literal
sections to be used for the code inside the delimited region.  The new
literal sections are determined by including NAME as a prefix to the
default literal section names.  If the NAME argument is omitted, the
literal sections revert to the defaults.  This directive has no effect
when using the `--text-section-literals' option (*note Command Line
Options: Xtensa Options.).

   Except for two special cases, the assembler determines the new
literal sections by simply prepending NAME to the default section names,
resulting in `NAME.literal' and `NAME.lit4' sections.  The
`literal_prefix' directive is often used with the name of the current
text section as the prefix argument.  To facilitate this usage, the
assembler uses special case rules when it recognizes NAME as a text
section name.  First, if NAME ends with `.text', that suffix is not
included in the literal section name.  For example, if NAME is
`.iram0.text', then the literal sections will be `.iram0.literal' and
`.iram0.lit4'.  Second, if NAME begins with `.gnu.linkonce.t.', then
the literal section names are formed by replacing the `.t' substring
with `.literal' and `.lit4'.  For example, if NAME is
`.gnu.linkonce.t.func', the literal sections will be
`.gnu.linkonce.literal.func' and `.gnu.linkonce.lit4.func'.


File: as.info,  Node: Absolute Literals Directive,  Prev: Literal Prefix Directive,  Up: Xtensa Directives

8.34.5.7 absolute-literals
..........................

The `absolute-literals' and `no-absolute-literals' directives control
the absolute vs. PC-relative mode for `L32R' instructions.  These are
relevant only for Xtensa configurations that include the absolute
addressing option for `L32R' instructions.

         .begin [no-]absolute-literals
         .end [no-]absolute-literals

   These directives do not change the `L32R' mode--they only cause the
assembler to emit the appropriate kind of relocation for `L32R'
instructions and to place the literal values in the appropriate section.
To change the `L32R' mode, the program must write the `LITBASE' special
register.  It is the programmer's responsibility to keep track of the
mode and indicate to the assembler which mode is used in each region of
code.

   If the Xtensa configuration includes the absolute `L32R' addressing
option, the default is to assume absolute `L32R' addressing unless the
`--no-absolute-literals' command-line option is specified.  Otherwise,
the default is to assume PC-relative `L32R' addressing.  The
`absolute-literals' directive can then be used to override the default
determined by the command-line options.

9 Reporting Bugs
****************

Your bug reports play an essential role in making `as' reliable.

   Reporting a bug may help you by bringing a solution to your problem,
or it may not.  But in any case the principal function of a bug report
is to help the entire community by making the next version of `as' work
better.  Bug reports are your contribution to the maintenance of `as'.

   In order for a bug report to serve its purpose, you must include the
information that enables us to fix the bug.

* Menu:

* Bug Criteria::                Have you found a bug?

File: as.info,  Node: Bug Criteria,  Next: Bug Reporting,  Up: Reporting Bugs

9.1 Have You Found a Bug?
=========================

If you are not sure whether you have found a bug, here are some
guidelines:

   * If the assembler gets a fatal signal, for any input whatever, that
     is a `as' bug.  Reliable assemblers never crash.

   * If `as' produces an error message for valid input, that is a bug.

   * If `as' does not produce an error message for invalid input, that
     is a bug.  However, you should note that your idea of "invalid
     input" might be our idea of "an extension" or "support for
     traditional practice".

   * If you are an experienced user of assemblers, your suggestions for
     improvement of `as' are welcome in any case.


File: as.info,  Node: Bug Reporting,  Prev: Bug Criteria,  Up: Reporting Bugs

9.2 How to Report Bugs
======================

A number of companies and individuals offer support for GNU products.
If you obtained `as' from a support organization, we recommend you
contact that organization first.

   You can find contact information for many support companies and
individuals in the file `etc/SERVICE' in the GNU Emacs distribution.

   In any event, we also recommend that you send bug reports for `as'
to `bug-binutils@@gnu.org'.

   The fundamental principle of reporting bugs usefully is this:
*report all the facts*.  If you are not sure whether to state a fact or
leave it out, state it!

   Often people omit facts because they think they know what causes the
problem and assume that some details do not matter.  Thus, you might
assume that the name of a symbol you use in an example does not matter.
Well, probably it does not, but one cannot be sure.  Perhaps the bug
is a stray memory reference which happens to fetch from the location
where that name is stored in memory; perhaps, if the name were
different, the contents of that location would fool the assembler into
doing the right thing despite the bug.  Play it safe and give a
specific, complete example.  That is the easiest thing for you to do,
and the most helpful.

   Keep in mind that the purpose of a bug report is to enable us to fix
the bug if it is new to us.  Therefore, always write your bug reports
on the assumption that the bug has not been reported previously.

   Sometimes people give a few sketchy facts and ask, "Does this ring a
bell?"  This cannot help us fix a bug, so it is basically useless.  We
respond by asking for enough details to enable us to investigate.  You
might as well expedite matters by sending them to begin with.

   To enable us to fix the bug, you should include all these things:

   * The version of `as'.  `as' announces it if you start it with the
     `--version' argument.

     Without this, we will not know whether there is any point in
     looking for the bug in the current version of `as'.

   * Any patches you may have applied to the `as' source.

   * The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name
     and version number.

   * What compiler (and its version) was used to compile `as'--e.g.
     "`gcc-2.7'".

   * The command arguments you gave the assembler to assemble your
     example and observe the bug.  To guarantee you will not omit
     something important, list them all.  A copy of the Makefile (or
     the output from make) is sufficient.

     If we were to try to guess the arguments, we would probably guess
     wrong and then we might not encounter the bug.

   * A complete input file that will reproduce the bug.  If the bug is
     observed when the assembler is invoked via a compiler, send the
     assembler source, not the high level language source.  Most
     compilers will produce the assembler source when run with the `-S'
     option.  If you are using `gcc', use the options `-v
     --save-temps'; this will save the assembler source in a file with
     an extension of `.s', and also show you exactly how `as' is being
     run.

   * A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
     incorrect.  For example, "It gets a fatal signal."

     Of course, if the bug is that `as' gets a fatal signal, then we
     will certainly notice it.  But if the bug is incorrect output, we
     might not notice unless it is glaringly wrong.  You might as well
     not give us a chance to make a mistake.

     Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should
     still say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on,
     such as, your copy of `as' is out of synch, or you have
     encountered a bug in the C library on your system.  (This has
     happened!)  Your copy might crash and ours would not.  If you told
     us to expect a crash, then when ours fails to crash, we would know
     that the bug was not happening for us.  If you had not told us to
     expect a crash, then we would not be able to draw any conclusion
     from our observations.

   * If you wish to suggest changes to the `as' source, send us context
     diffs, as generated by `diff' with the `-u', `-c', or `-p' option.
     Always send diffs from the old file to the new file.  If you even
     discuss something in the `as' source, refer to it by context, not
     by line number.

     The line numbers in our development sources will not match those
     in your sources.  Your line numbers would convey no useful
     information to us.

   Here are some things that are not necessary:

   * A description of the envelope of the bug.

     Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
     which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
     changes will not affect it.

     This is often time consuming and not very useful, because the way
     we will find the bug is by running a single example under the
     debugger with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of
     examples.  We recommend that you save your time for something else.

     Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report _instead_
     of the original one, that is a convenience for us.  Errors in the
     output will be easier to spot, running under the debugger will take
     less time, and so on.

     However, simplification is not vital; if you do not want to do
     this, report the bug anyway and send us the entire test case you
     used.

   * A patch for the bug.

     A patch for the bug does help us if it is a good one.  But do not
     omit the necessary information, such as the test case, on the
     assumption that a patch is all we need.  We might see problems
     with your patch and decide to fix the problem another way, or we
     might not understand it at all.

     Sometimes with a program as complicated as `as' it is very hard to
     construct an example that will make the program follow a certain
     path through the code.  If you do not send us the example, we will
     not be able to construct one, so we will not be able to verify
     that the bug is fixed.

     And if we cannot understand what bug you are trying to fix, or why
     your patch should be an improvement, we will not install it.  A
     test case will help us to understand.

   * A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

     Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even we cannot guess right about
     such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.

*******************

If you have contributed to GAS and your name isn't listed here, it is
not meant as a slight.  We just don't know about it.  Send mail to the
maintainer, and we'll correct the situation.  Currently the maintainer
is Ken Raeburn (email address `raeburn@@cygnus.com').

   Dean Elsner wrote the original GNU assembler for the VAX.(1)

   Jay Fenlason maintained GAS for a while, adding support for
GDB-specific debug information and the 68k series machines, most of the
preprocessing pass, and extensive changes in `messages.c',
`input-file.c', `write.c'.

   K. Richard Pixley maintained GAS for a while, adding various
enhancements and many bug fixes, including merging support for several
processors, breaking GAS up to handle multiple object file format back
ends (including heavy rewrite, testing, an integration of the coff and
b.out back ends), adding configuration including heavy testing and
verification of cross assemblers and file splits and renaming,
converted GAS to strictly ANSI C including full prototypes, added
support for m680[34]0 and cpu32, did considerable work on i960
including a COFF port (including considerable amounts of reverse
engineering), a SPARC opcode file rewrite, DECstation, rs6000, and
hp300hpux host ports, updated "know" assertions and made them work,
much other reorganization, cleanup, and lint.

   Ken Raeburn wrote the high-level BFD interface code to replace most
of the code in format-specific I/O modules.

   The original VMS support was contributed by David L. Kashtan.  Eric
Youngdale has done much work with it since.

   The Intel 80386 machine description was written by Eliot Dresselhaus.

   Minh Tran-Le at IntelliCorp contributed some AIX 386 support.

   The Motorola 88k machine description was contributed by Devon Bowen
of Buffalo University and Torbjorn Granlund of the Swedish Institute of
Computer Science.

   Keith Knowles at the Open Software Foundation wrote the original
MIPS back end (`tc-mips.c', `tc-mips.h'), and contributed Rose format
support (which hasn't been merged in yet).  Ralph Campbell worked with
the MIPS code to support a.out format.

   Support for the Zilog Z8k and Renesas H8/300 and H8/500 processors
(tc-z8k, tc-h8300, tc-h8500), and IEEE 695 object file format
(obj-ieee), was written by Steve Chamberlain of Cygnus Support.  Steve
also modified the COFF back end to use BFD for some low-level
operations, for use with the H8/300 and AMD 29k targets.

   John Gilmore built the AMD 29000 support, added `.include' support,
and simplified the configuration of which versions accept which
directives.  He updated the 68k machine description so that Motorola's
opcodes always produced fixed-size instructions (e.g., `jsr'), while
synthetic instructions remained shrinkable (`jbsr').  John fixed many
bugs, including true tested cross-compilation support, and one bug in
relaxation that took a week and required the proverbial one-bit fix.

   Ian Lance Taylor of Cygnus Support merged the Motorola and MIT
syntax for the 68k, completed support for some COFF targets (68k, i386
SVR3, and SCO Unix), added support for MIPS ECOFF and ELF targets,
wrote the initial RS/6000 and PowerPC assembler, and made a few other
minor patches.

   Steve Chamberlain made GAS able to generate listings.

   Hewlett-Packard contributed support for the HP9000/300.

   Jeff Law wrote GAS and BFD support for the native HPPA object format
(SOM) along with a fairly extensive HPPA testsuite (for both SOM and
ELF object formats).  This work was supported by both the Center for
Software Science at the University of Utah and Cygnus Support.

   Support for ELF format files has been worked on by Mark Eichin of
Cygnus Support (original, incomplete implementation for SPARC), Pete
Hoogenboom and Jeff Law at the University of Utah (HPPA mainly),
Michael Meissner of the Open Software Foundation (i386 mainly), and Ken
Raeburn of Cygnus Support (sparc, and some initial 64-bit support).

   Linas Vepstas added GAS support for the ESA/390 "IBM 370"
architecture.

   Richard Henderson rewrote the Alpha assembler. Klaus Kaempf wrote
GAS and BFD support for openVMS/Alpha.

   Timothy Wall, Michael Hayes, and Greg Smart contributed to the
various tic* flavors.

   David Heine, Sterling Augustine, Bob Wilson and John Ruttenberg from
Tensilica, Inc. added support for Xtensa processors.

   Several engineers at Cygnus Support have also provided many small
bug fixes and configuration enhancements.

   Many others have contributed large or small bugfixes and
enhancements.  If you have contributed significant work and are not
mentioned on this list, and want to be, let us know.  Some of the
history has been lost; we are not intentionally leaving anyone out.

Appendix A GNU Free Documentation License
*****************************************

                        Version 1.1, March 2000

     Copyright (C) 2000, 2003 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
     written document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
     the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
     modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
     this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
     credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
     license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.


  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
     under the terms of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to
     any such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee,
     and is addressed as "you."

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
     Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
     mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)
     The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with
     the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
     represented in a format whose specification is available to the
     general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly
     and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to
     text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed
     to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not
     Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque."

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification.
     Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that
     can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML
     or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
     available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
     processors for output purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
     plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the
     material this License requires to appear in the title page.  For
     works in formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title
     Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of the
     work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you
     add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You
     may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading
     or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However,
     you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If you
     distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow
     the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
     100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you
     must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly,
     all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly
     and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies.  The
     front cover must present the full title with all words of the
     title equally prominent and visible.  You may add other material
     on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes limited to the
     covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and
     satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in
     other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible
     computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
     of the Document, free of added material, which the general
     network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
     charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
     latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
     begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
     this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
     location until at least one year after the last time you
     distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
     the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to
     whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do these
     things in the Modified Version:

     A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
     distinct    from that of the Document, and from those of previous
     versions    (which should, if there were any, be listed in the
     History section    of the Document).  You may use the same title
     as a previous version    if the original publisher of that version
     gives permission.
     B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
     entities    responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
     Modified    Version, together with at least five of the principal
     authors of the    Document (all of its principal authors, if it
     has less than five).
     C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
     Modified Version, as the publisher.
     D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
     E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
     adjacent to the other copyright notices.
     F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
     notice    giving the public permission to use the Modified Version
     under the    terms of this License, in the form shown in the
     Addendum below.
     G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
     Sections    and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
     license notice.
     H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
     I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add
     to    it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.
     If    there is no section entitled "History" in the Document,
     create one    stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of
     the Document as    given on its Title Page, then add an item
     describing the Modified    Version as stated in the previous
     sentence.
     J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
     likewise    the network locations given in the Document for
     previous versions    it was based on.  These may be placed in the
     "History" section.     You may omit a network location for a work
     that was published at    least four years before the Document
     itself, or if the original    publisher of the version it refers
     to gives permission.
     K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
     preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
      substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
     and/or dedications given therein.
     L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
     unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
     or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
     M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements."  Such a section
     may not be included in the Modified Version.
     N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements"    or to
     conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do this,
     add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified
     Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct from any
     other section titles.

     You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
     nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
     parties-for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
     been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition
     of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the
     Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to
     assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
     copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name
     but different contents, make the title of each such section unique
     by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the
     original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a
     unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the section titles in
     the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the
     combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections entitled "Dedications."  You
     must delete all sections entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
     that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the
     rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert
     a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow
     this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of
     that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a
     Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation
     copyright is claimed for the compilation.  Such a compilation is
     called an "aggregate", and this License does not apply to the
     other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on
     account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves
     derivative works of the Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that surround only the Document within the
     aggregate.  Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole
     aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section
     4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
     permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
     translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
     original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
     translation of this License provided that you also include the
     original English version of this License.  In case of a
     disagreement between the translation and the original English
     version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other
     attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.


ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and license
notices just after the title page:

     Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
     Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
     under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
     or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
     with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the
     Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST.
     A copy of the license is included in the section entitled "GNU
     Free Documentation License."

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no Front-Cover
Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts being
LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.

Comments
========

   There are two ways of rendering comments to `as'.  In both cases the
comment is equivalent to one space.

   Anything from `/*' through the next `*/' is a comment.  This means
you may not nest these comments.

     /*
       The only way to include a newline ('\n') in a comment
       is to use this sort of comment.
     */
     
     /* This sort of comment does not nest. */

   Anything from the "line comment" character to the next newline is
considered a comment and is ignored.  The line comment character is `;'
for the AMD 29K family; `;' on the ARC; `@@' on the ARM; `;' for the
H8/300 family; `!' for the H8/500 family; `;' for the HPPA; `#' on the
i386 and x86-64; `#' on the i960; `;' for the PDP-11; `;' for picoJava;
`;' for Motorola PowerPC; `!' for the Renesas / SuperH SH; `!' on the
SPARC; `#' on the ip2k; `#' on the m32r; `|' on the 680x0; `#' on the
68HC11 and 68HC12; `;' on the M880x0; `#' on the Vax; `!' for the Z8000;
`#' on the V850; `#' for Xtensa systems; see *Note Machine
Dependencies::.

   On some machines there are two different line comment characters.
One character only begins a comment if it is the first non-whitespace
character on a line, while the other always begins a comment.

   The V850 assembler also supports a double dash as starting a comment
that extends to the end of the line.

   `--';

   To be compatible with past assemblers, lines that begin with `#'
have a special interpretation.  Following the `#' should be an absolute
expression (*note Expressions::): the logical line number of the _next_
line.  Then a string (*note Strings: Strings.) is allowed: if present
it is a new logical file name.  The rest of the line, if any, should be
whitespace.

   If the first non-whitespace characters on the line are not numeric,
the line is ignored.  (Just like a comment.)

                               # This is an ordinary comment.
     # 42-6 "new_file_name"    # New logical file name
                               # This is logical line # 36.
   This feature is deprecated, and may disappear from future versions
of `as'.

Symbols
=======

   A "symbol" is one or more characters chosen from the set of all
letters (both upper and lower case), digits and the three characters
`_.$'.  On most machines, you can also use `$' in symbol names;
exceptions are noted in *Note Machine Dependencies::.  No symbol may
begin with a digit.  Case is significant.  There is no length limit:
all characters are significant.  Symbols are delimited by characters
not in that set, or by the beginning of a file (since the source
program must end with a newline, the end of a file is not a possible
symbol delimiter).  *Note Symbols::.


File: as.info,  Node: Statements,  Next: Constants,  Prev: Symbol Intro,  Up: Syntax

Statements
==========

   A "statement" ends at a newline character (`\n') or line separator
character.  (The line separator is usually `;', unless this conflicts
with the comment character; *note Machine Dependencies::.)  The newline
or separator character is considered part of the preceding statement.
Newlines and separators within character constants are an exception:
they do not end statements.

   It is an error to end any statement with end-of-file:  the last
character of any input file should be a newline.

   An empty statement is allowed, and may include whitespace.  It is
ignored.

   A statement begins with zero or more labels, optionally followed by a
key symbol which determines what kind of statement it is.  The key
symbol determines the syntax of the rest of the statement.  If the
symbol begins with a dot `.' then the statement is an assembler
directive: typically valid for any computer.  If the symbol begins with
a letter the statement is an assembly language "instruction": it
assembles into a machine language instruction.  Different versions of
`as' for different computers recognize different instructions.  In
fact, the same symbol may represent a different instruction in a
different computer's assembly language.

   A label is a symbol immediately followed by a colon (`:').
Whitespace before a label or after a colon is permitted, but you may not
have whitespace between a label's symbol and its colon. *Note Labels::.

   For HPPA targets, labels need not be immediately followed by a
colon, but the definition of a label must begin in column zero.  This
also implies that only one label may be defined on each line.

     label:     .directive    followed by something
     another_label:           # This is an empty statement.

Character Constants
-------------------

   There are two kinds of character constants.  A "character" stands
for one character in one byte and its value may be used in numeric
expressions.  String constants (properly called string _literals_) are
potentially many bytes and their values may not be used in arithmetic
expressions.

File: as.info,  Node: Strings,  Next: Chars,  Up: Characters

Strings
.......

   A "string" is written between double-quotes.  It may contain
double-quotes or null characters.  The way to get special characters
into a string is to "escape" these characters: precede them with a
backslash `\' character.  For example `\\' represents one backslash:
the first `\' is an escape which tells `as' to interpret the second
character literally as a backslash (which prevents `as' from
recognizing the second `\' as an escape character).  The complete list
of escapes follows.

`\b'
     Mnemonic for backspace; for ASCII this is octal code 010.

`\f'
     Mnemonic for FormFeed; for ASCII this is octal code 014.

`\n'
     Mnemonic for newline; for ASCII this is octal code 012.

`\r'
     Mnemonic for carriage-Return; for ASCII this is octal code 015.

`\t'
     Mnemonic for horizontal Tab; for ASCII this is octal code 011.

`\ DIGIT DIGIT DIGIT'
     An octal character code.  The numeric code is 3 octal digits.  For
     compatibility with other Unix systems, 8 and 9 are accepted as
     digits: for example, `\008' has the value 010, and `\009' the
     value 011.

`\`x' HEX-DIGITS...'
     A hex character code.  All trailing hex digits are combined.
     Either upper or lower case `x' works.

`\\'
     Represents one `\' character.

`\"'
     Represents one `"' character.  Needed in strings to represent this
     character, because an unescaped `"' would end the string.

`\ ANYTHING-ELSE'
     Any other character when escaped by `\' gives a warning, but
     assembles as if the `\' was not present.  The idea is that if you
     used an escape sequence you clearly didn't want the literal
     interpretation of the following character.  However `as' has no
     other interpretation, so `as' knows it is giving you the wrong
     code and warns you of the fact.

   Which characters are escapable, and what those escapes represent,
varies widely among assemblers.  The current set is what we think the
BSD 4.2 assembler recognizes, and is a subset of what most C compilers
recognize.  If you are in doubt, do not use an escape sequence.


File: as.info,  Node: Chars,  Prev: Strings,  Up: Characters

Characters
..........

   A single character may be written as a single quote immediately
followed by that character.  The same escapes apply to characters as to
strings.  So if you want to write the character backslash, you must
write `'\\' where the first `\' escapes the second `\'.  As you can
see, the quote is an acute accent, not a grave accent.  A newline
immediately following an acute accent is taken as a literal character
and does not count as the end of a statement.  The value of a character
constant in a numeric expression is the machine's byte-wide code for
that character.  `as' assumes your character code is ASCII: `'A' means
65, `'B' means 66, and so on.

Number Constants
----------------

   `as' distinguishes three kinds of numbers according to how they are
stored in the target machine.  _Integers_ are numbers that would fit
into an `int' in the C language.  _Bignums_ are integers, but they are
stored in more than 32 bits.  _Flonums_ are floating point numbers,
described below.

* Menu:

* Integers::                    Integers

File: as.info,  Node: Integers,  Next: Bignums,  Up: Numbers

Integers
........

   A binary integer is `0b' or `0B' followed by zero or more of the
binary digits `01'.

   An octal integer is `0' followed by zero or more of the octal digits
(`01234567').

   A decimal integer starts with a non-zero digit followed by zero or
more digits (`0123456789').

   A hexadecimal integer is `0x' or `0X' followed by one or more
hexadecimal digits chosen from `0123456789abcdefABCDEF'.

   Integers have the usual values.  To denote a negative integer, use
the prefix operator `-' discussed under expressions (*note Prefix
Operators: Prefix Ops.).


File: as.info,  Node: Bignums,  Next: Flonums,  Prev: Integers,  Up: Numbers

Bignums
.......

   A "bignum" has the same syntax and semantics as an integer except
that the number (or its negative) takes more than 32 bits to represent
in binary.  The distinction is made because in some places integers are
permitted while bignums are not.


File: as.info,  Node: Flonums,  Prev: Bignums,  Up: Numbers

Flonums
.......

   A "flonum" represents a floating point number.  The translation is
indirect: a decimal floating point number from the text is converted by
`as' to a generic binary floating point number of more than sufficient
precision.  This generic floating point number is converted to a
particular computer's floating point format (or formats) by a portion
of `as' specialized to that computer.

   A flonum is written by writing (in order)
   * The digit `0'.  (`0' is optional on the HPPA.)

   * A letter, to tell `as' the rest of the number is a flonum.  `e' is
     recommended.  Case is not important.

     On the H8/300, H8/500, Renesas / SuperH SH, and AMD 29K
     architectures, the letter must be one of the letters `DFPRSX' (in
     upper or lower case).

     On the ARC, the letter must be one of the letters `DFRS' (in upper
     or lower case).

     On the Intel 960 architecture, the letter must be one of the
     letters `DFT' (in upper or lower case).

     On the HPPA architecture, the letter must be `E' (upper case only).

   * An optional sign: either `+' or `-'.

   * An optional "integer part": zero or more decimal digits.

   * An optional "fractional part": `.' followed by zero or more
     decimal digits.

   * An optional exponent, consisting of:

        * An `E' or `e'.

        * Optional sign: either `+' or `-'.

        * One or more decimal digits.


   At least one of the integer part or the fractional part must be
present.  The floating point number has the usual base-10 value.

   `as' does all processing using integers.  Flonums are computed
independently of any floating point hardware in the computer running
`as'.

Background
==========

   Roughly, a section is a range of addresses, with no gaps; all data
"in" those addresses is treated the same for some particular purpose.
For example there may be a "read only" section.

   The linker `ld' reads many object files (partial programs) and
combines their contents to form a runnable program.  When `as' emits an
object file, the partial program is assumed to start at address 0.
`ld' assigns the final addresses for the partial program, so that
different partial programs do not overlap.  This is actually an
oversimplification, but it suffices to explain how `as' uses sections.

   `ld' moves blocks of bytes of your program to their run-time
addresses.  These blocks slide to their run-time addresses as rigid
units; their length does not change and neither does the order of bytes
within them.  Such a rigid unit is called a _section_.  Assigning
run-time addresses to sections is called "relocation".  It includes the
task of adjusting mentions of object-file addresses so they refer to
the proper run-time addresses.  For the H8/300 and H8/500, and for the
Renesas / SuperH SH, `as' pads sections if needed to ensure they end on
a word (sixteen bit) boundary.

   An object file written by `as' has at least three sections, any of
which may be empty.  These are named "text", "data" and "bss" sections.

   When it generates COFF or ELF output, `as' can also generate
whatever other named sections you specify using the `.section'
directive (*note `.section': Section.).  If you do not use any
directives that place output in the `.text' or `.data' sections, these
sections still exist, but are empty.

   When `as' generates SOM or ELF output for the HPPA, `as' can also
generate whatever other named sections you specify using the `.space'
and `.subspace' directives.  See `HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language
Reference Manual' (HP 92432-90001) for details on the `.space' and
`.subspace' assembler directives.

   Additionally, `as' uses different names for the standard text, data,
and bss sections when generating SOM output.  Program text is placed
into the `$CODE$' section, data into `$DATA$', and BSS into `$BSS$'.

   Within the object file, the text section starts at address `0', the
data section follows, and the bss section follows the data section.

   When generating either SOM or ELF output files on the HPPA, the text
section starts at address `0', the data section at address `0x4000000',
and the bss section follows the data section.

   To let `ld' know which data changes when the sections are relocated,
and how to change that data, `as' also writes to the object file
details of the relocation needed.  To perform relocation `ld' must
know, each time an address in the object file is mentioned:
   * Where in the object file is the beginning of this reference to an
     address?

   * How long (in bytes) is this reference?

   * Which section does the address refer to?  What is the numeric
     value of
          (ADDRESS) - (START-ADDRESS OF SECTION)?

   * Is the reference to an address "Program-Counter relative"?

   In fact, every address `as' ever uses is expressed as
     (SECTION) + (OFFSET INTO SECTION)

Further, most expressions `as' computes have this section-relative
nature.  (For some object formats, such as SOM for the HPPA, some
expressions are symbol-relative instead.)

   In this manual we use the notation {SECNAME N} to mean "offset N
into section SECNAME."

   Apart from text, data and bss sections you need to know about the
"absolute" section.  When `ld' mixes partial programs, addresses in the
absolute section remain unchanged.  For example, address `{absolute 0}'
is "relocated" to run-time address 0 by `ld'.  Although the linker
never arranges two partial programs' data sections with overlapping
addresses after linking, _by definition_ their absolute sections must
overlap.  Address `{absolute 239}' in one part of a program is always
the same address when the program is running as address `{absolute
239}' in any other part of the program.

   The idea of sections is extended to the "undefined" section.  Any
address whose section is unknown at assembly time is by definition
rendered {undefined U}--where U is filled in later.  Since numbers are
always defined, the only way to generate an undefined address is to
mention an undefined symbol.  A reference to a named common block would
be such a symbol: its value is unknown at assembly time so it has
section _undefined_.

   By analogy the word _section_ is used to describe groups of sections
in the linked program.  `ld' puts all partial programs' text sections
in contiguous addresses in the linked program.  It is customary to
refer to the _text section_ of a program, meaning all the addresses of
all partial programs' text sections.  Likewise for data and bss
sections.

   Some sections are manipulated by `ld'; others are invented for use
of `as' and have no meaning except during assembly.

Linker Sections
===============

   `ld' deals with just four kinds of sections, summarized below.

*named sections*
*text section*
*data section*
     These sections hold your program.  `as' and `ld' treat them as
     separate but equal sections.  Anything you can say of one section
     is true of another.  When the program is running, however, it is
     customary for the text section to be unalterable.  The text
     section is often shared among processes: it contains instructions,
     constants and the like.  The data section of a running program is
     usually alterable: for example, C variables would be stored in the
     data section.

*bss section*
     This section contains zeroed bytes when your program begins
     running.  It is used to hold uninitialized variables or common
     storage.  The length of each partial program's bss section is
     important, but because it starts out containing zeroed bytes there
     is no need to store explicit zero bytes in the object file.  The
     bss section was invented to eliminate those explicit zeros from
     object files.

*absolute section*
     Address 0 of this section is always "relocated" to runtime address
     0.  This is useful if you want to refer to an address that `ld'
     must not change when relocating.  In this sense we speak of
     absolute addresses being "unrelocatable": they do not change
     during relocation.

*undefined section*
     This "section" is a catch-all for address references to objects
     not in the preceding sections.

   An idealized example of three relocatable sections follows.  The
example uses the traditional section names `.text' and `.data'.  Memory
addresses are on the horizontal axis.

                           +-----+----+--+
     partial program # 1:  |ttttt|dddd|00|

                           seg.   seg. seg.
     
                           +---+---+---+
     partial program # 2:  |TTT|DDD|000|

Assembler Internal Sections
===========================

   These sections are meant only for the internal use of `as'.  They
have no meaning at run-time.  You do not really need to know about these
sections for most purposes; but they can be mentioned in `as' warning
messages, so it might be helpful to have an idea of their meanings to
`as'.  These sections are used to permit the value of every expression
in your assembly language program to be a section-relative address.

ASSEMBLER-INTERNAL-LOGIC-ERROR!
     An internal assembler logic error has been found.  This means
     there is a bug in the assembler.

expr section
     The assembler stores complex expression internally as combinations
     of symbols.  When it needs to represent an expression as a symbol,
     it puts it in the expr section.


File: as.info,  Node: Sub-Sections,  Next: bss,  Prev: As Sections,  Up: Sections

Sub-Sections
============

   Assembled bytes conventionally fall into two sections: text and data.
You may have separate groups of data in named sections that you want to
end up near to each other in the object file, even though they are not
contiguous in the assembler source.  `as' allows you to use
"subsections" for this purpose.  Within each section, there can be
numbered subsections with values from 0 to 8192.  Objects assembled
into the same subsection go into the object file together with other
objects in the same subsection.  For example, a compiler might want to
store constants in the text section, but might not want to have them
interspersed with the program being assembled.  In this case, the
compiler could issue a `.text 0' before each section of code being
output, and a `.text 1' before each group of constants being output.

   Subsections are optional.  If you do not use subsections, everything
goes in subsection number zero.

   Each subsection is zero-padded up to a multiple of four bytes.
(Subsections may be padded a different amount on different flavors of
`as'.)

   Subsections appear in your object file in numeric order, lowest
numbered to highest.  (All this to be compatible with other people's
assemblers.)  The object file contains no representation of
subsections; `ld' and other programs that manipulate object files see
no trace of them.  They just see all your text subsections as a text
section, and all your data subsections as a data section.

   To specify which subsection you want subsequent statements assembled
into, use a numeric argument to specify it, in a `.text EXPRESSION' or
a `.data EXPRESSION' statement.  When generating COFF or ELF output, you
can also use an extra subsection argument with arbitrary named
sections: `.section NAME, EXPRESSION'.  EXPRESSION should be an
absolute expression.  (*Note Expressions::.)  If you just say `.text'
then `.text 0' is assumed.  Likewise `.data' means `.data 0'.  Assembly
begins in `text 0'.  For instance:
     .text 0     # The default subsection is text 0 anyway.
     .ascii "This lives in the first text subsection. *"
     .text 1
     .ascii "But this lives in the second text subsection."
     .data 0
     .ascii "This lives in the data section,"
     .ascii "in the first data subsection."
     .text 0
     .ascii "This lives in the first text section,"
     .ascii "immediately following the asterisk (*)."

   Each section has a "location counter" incremented by one for every
byte assembled into that section.  Because subsections are merely a
convenience restricted to `as' there is no concept of a subsection
location counter.  There is no way to directly manipulate a location
counter--but the `.align' directive changes it, and any label
definition captures its current value.  The location counter of the
section where statements are being assembled is said to be the "active"
location counter.


File: as.info,  Node: bss,  Prev: Sub-Sections,  Up: Sections

bss Section
===========

   The bss section is used for local common variable storage.  You may
allocate address space in the bss section, but you may not dictate data
to load into it before your program executes.  When your program starts
running, all the contents of the bss section are zeroed bytes.

   The `.lcomm' pseudo-op defines a symbol in the bss section; see
*Note `.lcomm': Lcomm.

   The `.comm' pseudo-op may be used to declare a common symbol, which
is another form of uninitialized symbol; see *Note `.comm': Comm.

   When assembling for a target which supports multiple sections, such
as ELF or COFF, you may switch into the `.bss' section and define
symbols as usual; see *Note `.section': Section.  You may only assemble
zero values into the section.  Typically the section will only contain
symbol definitions and `.skip' directives (*note `.skip': Skip.).

Symbols
*******

   Symbols are a central concept: the programmer uses symbols to name
things, the linker uses symbols to link, and the debugger uses symbols
to debug.

     _Warning:_ `as' does not place symbols in the object file in the
     same order they were declared.  This may break some debuggers.

Labels
======

   A "label" is written as a symbol immediately followed by a colon
`:'.  The symbol then represents the current value of the active
location counter, and is, for example, a suitable instruction operand.
You are warned if you use the same symbol to represent two different
locations: the first definition overrides any other definitions.

   On the HPPA, the usual form for a label need not be immediately
followed by a colon, but instead must start in column zero.  Only one
label may be defined on a single line.  To work around this, the HPPA
version of `as' also provides a special directive `.label' for defining
labels more flexibly.

Giving Symbols Other Values
===========================

   A symbol can be given an arbitrary value by writing a symbol,
followed by an equals sign `=', followed by an expression (*note
Expressions::).  This is equivalent to using the `.set' directive.
*Note `.set': Set.

Symbol Names
============

   Symbol names begin with a letter or with one of `._'.  On most
machines, you can also use `$' in symbol names; exceptions are noted in
*Note Machine Dependencies::.  That character may be followed by any
string of digits, letters, dollar signs (unless otherwise noted in
*Note Machine Dependencies::), and underscores.  For the AMD 29K
family, `?' is also allowed in the body of a symbol name, though not at
its beginning.

   Case of letters is significant: `foo' is a different symbol name
than `Foo'.

   Each symbol has exactly one name.  Each name in an assembly language
program refers to exactly one symbol.  You may use that symbol name any
number of times in a program.

Local Symbol Names
------------------

   Local symbols help compilers and programmers use names temporarily.
They create symbols which are guaranteed to be unique over the entire
scope of the input source code and which can be referred to by a simple
notation.  To define a local symbol, write a label of the form `N:'
(where N represents any positive integer).  To refer to the most recent
previous definition of that symbol write `Nb', using the same number as
when you defined the label.  To refer to the next definition of a local
label, write `Nf'-- The `b' stands for"backwards" and the `f' stands
for "forwards".

   There is no restriction on how you can use these labels, and you can
reuse them too.  So that it is possible to repeatedly define the same
local label (using the same number `N'), although you can only refer to
the most recently defined local label of that number (for a backwards
reference) or the next definition of a specific local label for a
forward reference.  It is also worth noting that the first 10 local
labels (`0:'...`9:') are implemented in a slightly more efficient
manner than the others.

   Here is an example:

     1:        branch 1f
     2:        branch 1b
     1:        branch 2f
     2:        branch 1b

   Which is the equivalent of:

     label_1:  branch label_3
     label_2:  branch label_1
     label_3:  branch label_4
     label_4:  branch label_3

   Local symbol names are only a notational device.  They are
immediately transformed into more conventional symbol names before the
assembler uses them.  The symbol names stored in the symbol table,
appearing in error messages and optionally emitted to the object file.
The names are constructed using these parts:

`L'
     All local labels begin with `L'. Normally both `as' and `ld'
     forget symbols that start with `L'. These labels are used for
     symbols you are never intended to see.  If you use the `-L' option
     then `as' retains these symbols in the object file. If you also
     instruct `ld' to retain these symbols, you may use them in
     debugging.

`NUMBER'
     This is the number that was used in the local label definition.
     So if the label is written `55:' then the number is `55'.

`C-B'
     This unusual character is included so you do not accidentally
     invent a symbol of the same name.  The character has ASCII value
     of `\002' (control-B).

`_ordinal number_'
     This is a serial number to keep the labels distinct.  The first
     definition of `0:' gets the number `1'.  The 15th definition of
     `0:' gets the number `15', and so on.  Likewise the first
     definition of `1:' gets the number `1' and its 15th defintion gets
     `15' as well.

   So for example, the first `1:' is named `L1C-B1', the 44th `3:' is
named `L3C-B44'.

Dollar Local Labels
-------------------

   `as' also supports an even more local form of local labels called
dollar labels.  These labels go out of scope (ie they become undefined)
as soon as a non-local label is defined.  Thus they remain valid for
only a small region of the input source code.  Normal local labels, by
contrast, remain in scope for the entire file, or until they are
redefined by another occurrence of the same local label.

   Dollar labels are defined in exactly the same way as ordinary local
labels, except that instead of being terminated by a colon, they are
terminated by a dollar sign.  eg `55$'.

   They can also be distinguished from ordinary local labels by their
transformed name which uses ASCII character `\001' (control-A) as the
magic character to distinguish them from ordinary labels.  Thus the 5th
defintion of `6$' is named `L6C-A5'.

The Special Dot Symbol
======================

   The special symbol `.' refers to the current address that `as' is
assembling into.  Thus, the expression `melvin: .long .' defines
`melvin' to contain its own address.  Assigning a value to `.' is
treated the same as a `.org' directive.  Thus, the expression `.=.+4'
is the same as saying `.space 4'.

Symbol Attributes
=================

   Every symbol has, as well as its name, the attributes "Value" and
"Type".  Depending on output format, symbols can also have auxiliary
attributes.

   If you use a symbol without defining it, `as' assumes zero for all
these attributes, and probably won't warn you.  This makes the symbol
an externally defined symbol, which is generally what you would want.

Value
-----

   The value of a symbol is (usually) 32 bits.  For a symbol which
labels a location in the text, data, bss or absolute sections the value
is the number of addresses from the start of that section to the label.
Naturally for text, data and bss sections the value of a symbol changes
as `ld' changes section base addresses during linking.  Absolute
symbols' values do not change during linking: that is why they are
called absolute.

   The value of an undefined symbol is treated in a special way.  If it
is 0 then the symbol is not defined in this assembler source file, and
`ld' tries to determine its value from other files linked into the same
program.  You make this kind of symbol simply by mentioning a symbol
name without defining it.  A non-zero value represents a `.comm' common
declaration.  The value is how much common storage to reserve, in bytes
(addresses).  The symbol refers to the first address of the allocated
storage.

Type
----

   The type attribute of a symbol contains relocation (section)
information, any flag settings indicating that a symbol is external, and
(optionally), other information for linkers and debuggers.  The exact
format depends on the object-code output format in use.

Expressions
***********

   An "expression" specifies an address or numeric value.  Whitespace
may precede and/or follow an expression.

   The result of an expression must be an absolute number, or else an
offset into a particular section.  If an expression is not absolute,
and there is not enough information when `as' sees the expression to
know its section, a second pass over the source program might be
necessary to interpret the expression--but the second pass is currently
not implemented.  `as' aborts with an error message in this situation.

File: as.info,  Node: Empty Exprs,  Next: Integer Exprs,  Up: Expressions

Empty Expressions
=================

   An empty expression has no value: it is just whitespace or null.
Wherever an absolute expression is required, you may omit the
expression, and `as' assumes a value of (absolute) 0.  This is
compatible with other assemblers.

Integer Expressions
===================

   An "integer expression" is one or more _arguments_ delimited by
_operators_.

File: as.info,  Node: Arguments,  Next: Operators,  Up: Integer Exprs

Arguments
---------

   "Arguments" are symbols, numbers or subexpressions.  In other
contexts arguments are sometimes called "arithmetic operands".  In this
manual, to avoid confusing them with the "instruction operands" of the
machine language, we use the term "argument" to refer to parts of
expressions only, reserving the word "operand" to refer only to machine
instruction operands.

   Symbols are evaluated to yield {SECTION NNN} where SECTION is one of
text, data, bss, absolute, or undefined.  NNN is a signed, 2's
complement 32 bit integer.

   Numbers are usually integers.

   A number can be a flonum or bignum.  In this case, you are warned
that only the low order 32 bits are used, and `as' pretends these 32
bits are an integer.  You may write integer-manipulating instructions
that act on exotic constants, compatible with other assemblers.

   Subexpressions are a left parenthesis `(' followed by an integer
expression, followed by a right parenthesis `)'; or a prefix operator
followed by an argument.


File: as.info,  Node: Operators,  Next: Prefix Ops,  Prev: Arguments,  Up: Integer Exprs

Operators
---------

   "Operators" are arithmetic functions, like `+' or `%'.  Prefix
operators are followed by an argument.  Infix operators appear between
their arguments.  Operators may be preceded and/or followed by
whitespace.


File: as.info,  Node: Prefix Ops,  Next: Infix Ops,  Prev: Operators,  Up: Integer Exprs

Prefix Operator
---------------

   `as' has the following "prefix operators".  They each take one
argument, which must be absolute.

`-'
     "Negation".  Two's complement negation.

`~'
     "Complementation".  Bitwise not.


File: as.info,  Node: Infix Ops,  Prev: Prefix Ops,  Up: Integer Exprs

Infix Operators
---------------

   "Infix operators" take two arguments, one on either side.  Operators
have precedence, but operations with equal precedence are performed left
to right.  Apart from `+' or `-', both arguments must be absolute, and
the result is absolute.

  1. Highest Precedence

    `*'
          "Multiplication".

    `/'
          "Division".  Truncation is the same as the C operator `/'

    `%'
          "Remainder".

    `<'
    `<<'
          "Shift Left".  Same as the C operator `<<'.

    `>'
    `>>'
          "Shift Right".  Same as the C operator `>>'.

  2. Intermediate precedence

    `|'
          "Bitwise Inclusive Or".

    `&'
          "Bitwise And".

    `^'
          "Bitwise Exclusive Or".

    `!'
          "Bitwise Or Not".

  3. Low Precedence

    `+'
          "Addition".  If either argument is absolute, the result has
          the section of the other argument.  You may not add together
          arguments from different sections.

    `-'
          "Subtraction".  If the right argument is absolute, the result
          has the section of the left argument.  If both arguments are
          in the same section, the result is absolute.  You may not
          subtract arguments from different sections.

    `=='
          "Is Equal To"

    `<>'
          "Is Not Equal To"

    `<'
          "Is Less Than"

    `>'
          "Is Greater Than"

    `>='
          "Is Greater Than Or Equal To"

    `<='
          "Is Less Than Or Equal To"

          The comparison operators can be used as infix operators.  A
          true results has a value of -1 whereas a false result has a
          value of 0.   Note, these operators perform signed
          comparisons.

  4. Lowest Precedence

    `&&'
          "Logical And".

    `||'
          "Logical Or".

          These two logical operations can be used to combine the
          results of sub expressions.  Note, unlike the comparison
          operators a true result returns a value of 1 but a false
          results does still return 0.  Also note that the logical or
          operator has a slightly lower precedence than logical and.


   In short, it's only meaningful to add or subtract the _offsets_ in an
address; you can only have a defined section in one of the two
arguments.

`.abort'
========

   This directive stops the assembly immediately.  It is for
compatibility with other assemblers.  The original idea was that the
assembly language source would be piped into the assembler.  If the
sender of the source quit, it could use this directive tells `as' to
quit also.  One day `.abort' will not be supported.

`.align ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
=====================================

   Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment required, as described below.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The way the required alignment is specified varies from system to
system.  For the a29k, hppa, m68k, m88k, w65, sparc, Xtensa, and
Renesas / SuperH SH, and i386 using ELF format, the first expression is
the alignment request in bytes.  For example `.align 8' advances the
location counter until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   For other systems, including the i386 using a.out format, and the
arm and strongarm, it is the number of low-order zero bits the location
counter must have after advancement.  For example `.align 3' advances
the location counter until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   This inconsistency is due to the different behaviors of the various
native assemblers for these systems which GAS must emulate.  GAS also
provides `.balign' and `.p2align' directives, described later, which
have a consistent behavior across all architectures (but are specific
to GAS).

Statements
==========

   A "statement" ends at a newline character (`\n') or line separator
character.  (The line separator is usually `;', unless this conflicts
with the comment character; *note Machine Dependencies::.)  The newline
or separator character is considered part of the preceding statement.
Newlines and separators within character constants are an exception:
they do not end statements.

   It is an error to end any statement with end-of-file:  the last
character of any input file should be a newline.

   An empty statement is allowed, and may include whitespace.  It is
ignored.

   A statement begins with zero or more labels, optionally followed by a
key symbol which determines what kind of statement it is.  The key
symbol determines the syntax of the rest of the statement.  If the
symbol begins with a dot `.' then the statement is an assembler
directive: typically valid for any computer.  If the symbol begins with
a letter the statement is an assembly language "instruction": it
assembles into a machine language instruction.  Different versions of
`as' for different computers recognize different instructions.  In
fact, the same symbol may represent a different instruction in a
different computer's assembly language.

   A label is a symbol immediately followed by a colon (`:').
Whitespace before a label or after a colon is permitted, but you may not
have whitespace between a label's symbol and its colon. *Note Labels::.

   For HPPA targets, labels need not be immediately followed by a
colon, but the definition of a label must begin in column zero.  This
also implies that only one label may be defined on each line.

     label:     .directive    followed by something

Character Constants
-------------------

   There are two kinds of character constants.  A "character" stands
for one character in one byte and its value may be used in numeric
expressions.  String constants (properly called string _literals_) are
potentially many bytes and their values may not be used in arithmetic
expressions.

Strings
.......

   A "string" is written between double-quotes.  It may contain
double-quotes or null characters.  The way to get special characters
into a string is to "escape" these characters: precede them with a
backslash `\' character.  For example `\\' represents one backslash:
the first `\' is an escape which tells `as' to interpret the second
character literally as a backslash (which prevents `as' from
recognizing the second `\' as an escape character).  The complete list
of escapes follows.

`\b'
     Mnemonic for backspace; for ASCII this is octal code 010.

`\f'
     Mnemonic for FormFeed; for ASCII this is octal code 014.

`\n'
     Mnemonic for newline; for ASCII this is octal code 012.

`\r'
     Mnemonic for carriage-Return; for ASCII this is octal code 015.

`\t'
     Mnemonic for horizontal Tab; for ASCII this is octal code 011.

`\ DIGIT DIGIT DIGIT'
     An octal character code.  The numeric code is 3 octal digits.  For
     compatibility with other Unix systems, 8 and 9 are accepted as
     digits: for example, `\008' has the value 010, and `\009' the
     value 011.

`\`x' HEX-DIGITS...'
     A hex character code.  All trailing hex digits are combined.
     Either upper or lower case `x' works.

`\\'
     Represents one `\' character.

`\"'
     Represents one `"' character.  Needed in strings to represent this
     character, because an unescaped `"' would end the string.

`\ ANYTHING-ELSE'
     Any other character when escaped by `\' gives a warning, but
     assembles as if the `\' was not present.  The idea is that if you
     used an escape sequence you clearly didn't want the literal
     interpretation of the following character.  However `as' has no
     other interpretation, so `as' knows it is giving you the wrong
     code and warns you of the fact.

   Which characters are escapable, and what those escapes represent,
varies widely among assemblers.  The current set is what we think the
BSD 4.2 assembler recognizes, and is a subset of what most C compilers
recognize.  If you are in doubt, do not use an escape sequence.


File: as.info,  Node: Chars,  Prev: Strings,  Up: Characters

Characters
..........

   A single character may be written as a single quote immediately
followed by that character.  The same escapes apply to characters as to
strings.  So if you want to write the character backslash, you must
write `'\\' where the first `\' escapes the second `\'.  As you can
see, the quote is an acute accent, not a grave accent.  A newline
immediately following an acute accent is taken as a literal character
and does not count as the end of a statement.  The value of a character
constant in a numeric expression is the machine's byte-wide code for
that character.  `as' assumes your character code is ASCII: `'A' means
65, `'B' means 66, and so on.

Number Constants
----------------

   `as' distinguishes three kinds of numbers according to how they are
stored in the target machine.  _Integers_ are numbers that would fit
into an `int' in the C language.  _Bignums_ are integers, but they are
stored in more than 32 bits.  _Flonums_ are floating point numbers,
described below.

* Menu:

* Integers::                    Integers
* Bignums::                     Bignums
* Flonums::                     Flonums


File: as.info,  Node: Integers,  Next: Bignums,  Up: Numbers

Integers
........

   A binary integer is `0b' or `0B' followed by zero or more of the
binary digits `01'.

   An octal integer is `0' followed by zero or more of the octal digits
(`01234567').

   A decimal integer starts with a non-zero digit followed by zero or
more digits (`0123456789').

   A hexadecimal integer is `0x' or `0X' followed by one or more
hexadecimal digits chosen from `0123456789abcdefABCDEF'.

   Integers have the usual values.  To denote a negative integer, use
the prefix operator `-' discussed under expressions (*note Prefix
Operators: Prefix Ops.).


File: as.info,  Node: Bignums,  Next: Flonums,  Prev: Integers,  Up: Numbers

Bignums
.......

   A "bignum" has the same syntax and semantics as an integer except
that the number (or its negative) takes more than 32 bits to represent
in binary.  The distinction is made because in some places integers are
permitted while bignums are not.


File: as.info,  Node: Flonums,  Prev: Bignums,  Up: Numbers

Flonums
.......

   A "flonum" represents a floating point number.  The translation is
indirect: a decimal floating point number from the text is converted by
`as' to a generic binary floating point number of more than sufficient
precision.  This generic floating point number is converted to a
particular computer's floating point format (or formats) by a portion
of `as' specialized to that computer.

   A flonum is written by writing (in order)
   * The digit `0'.  (`0' is optional on the HPPA.)

   * A letter, to tell `as' the rest of the number is a flonum.  `e' is
     recommended.  Case is not important.

     On the H8/300, H8/500, Hitachi SH, and AMD 29K architectures, the
     letter must be one of the letters `DFPRSX' (in upper or lower
     case).

     On the ARC, the letter must be one of the letters `DFRS' (in upper
     or lower case).

     On the Intel 960 architecture, the letter must be one of the
     letters `DFT' (in upper or lower case).

     On the HPPA architecture, the letter must be `E' (upper case only).

   * An optional sign: either `+' or `-'.

   * An optional "integer part": zero or more decimal digits.

   * An optional "fractional part": `.' followed by zero or more
     decimal digits.

   * An optional exponent, consisting of:

        * An `E' or `e'.

        * Optional sign: either `+' or `-'.

        * One or more decimal digits.


   At least one of the integer part or the fractional part must be
present.  The floating point number has the usual base-10 value.

   `as' does all processing using integers.  Flonums are computed
independently of any floating point hardware in the computer running
`as'.

Background
==========

   Roughly, a section is a range of addresses, with no gaps; all data
"in" those addresses is treated the same for some particular purpose.
For example there may be a "read only" section.

   The linker `ld' reads many object files (partial programs) and
combines their contents to form a runnable program.  When `as' emits an
object file, the partial program is assumed to start at address 0.
`ld' assigns the final addresses for the partial program, so that
different partial programs do not overlap.  This is actually an
oversimplification, but it suffices to explain how `as' uses sections.

   `ld' moves blocks of bytes of your program to their run-time
addresses.  These blocks slide to their run-time addresses as rigid
units; their length does not change and neither does the order of bytes
within them.  Such a rigid unit is called a _section_.  Assigning
run-time addresses to sections is called "relocation".  It includes the
task of adjusting mentions of object-file addresses so they refer to
the proper run-time addresses.  For the H8/300 and H8/500, and for the
Hitachi SH, `as' pads sections if needed to ensure they end on a word
(sixteen bit) boundary.

   An object file written by `as' has at least three sections, any of
which may be empty.  These are named "text", "data" and "bss" sections.

   When it generates COFF output, `as' can also generate whatever other
named sections you specify using the `.section' directive (*note
`.section': Section.).  If you do not use any directives that place
output in the `.text' or `.data' sections, these sections still exist,
but are empty.

   When `as' generates SOM or ELF output for the HPPA, `as' can also
generate whatever other named sections you specify using the `.space'
and `.subspace' directives.  See `HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language
Reference Manual' (HP 92432-90001) for details on the `.space' and
`.subspace' assembler directives.

   Additionally, `as' uses different names for the standard text, data,
and bss sections when generating SOM output.  Program text is placed
into the `$CODE$' section, data into `$DATA$', and BSS into `$BSS$'.

   Within the object file, the text section starts at address `0', the
data section follows, and the bss section follows the data section.

   When generating either SOM or ELF output files on the HPPA, the text
section starts at address `0', the data section at address `0x4000000',
and the bss section follows the data section.

   To let `ld' know which data changes when the sections are relocated,
and how to change that data, `as' also writes to the object file
details of the relocation needed.  To perform relocation `ld' must
know, each time an address in the object file is mentioned:
   * Where in the object file is the beginning of this reference to an
     address?

   * How long (in bytes) is this reference?

   * Which section does the address refer to?  What is the numeric
     value of
          (ADDRESS) - (START-ADDRESS OF SECTION)?

   * Is the reference to an address "Program-Counter relative"?

   In fact, every address `as' ever uses is expressed as
     (SECTION) + (OFFSET INTO SECTION)

Further, most expressions `as' computes have this section-relative
nature.  (For some object formats, such as SOM for the HPPA, some
expressions are symbol-relative instead.)

   In this manual we use the notation {SECNAME N} to mean "offset N
into section SECNAME."

   Apart from text, data and bss sections you need to know about the
"absolute" section.  When `ld' mixes partial programs, addresses in the
absolute section remain unchanged.  For example, address `{absolute 0}'
is "relocated" to run-time address 0 by `ld'.  Although the linker
never arranges two partial programs' data sections with overlapping
addresses after linking, _by definition_ their absolute sections must
overlap.  Address `{absolute 239}' in one part of a program is always
the same address when the program is running as address `{absolute
239}' in any other part of the program.

   The idea of sections is extended to the "undefined" section.  Any
address whose section is unknown at assembly time is by definition
rendered {undefined U}--where U is filled in later.  Since numbers are
always defined, the only way to generate an undefined address is to
mention an undefined symbol.  A reference to a named common block would
be such a symbol: its value is unknown at assembly time so it has
section _undefined_.

   By analogy the word _section_ is used to describe groups of sections
in the linked program.  `ld' puts all partial programs' text sections
in contiguous addresses in the linked program.  It is customary to
refer to the _text section_ of a program, meaning all the addresses of
all partial programs' text sections.  Likewise for data and bss
sections.

   Some sections are manipulated by `ld'; others are invented for use
of `as' and have no meaning except during assembly.


File: as.info,  Node: Ld Sections,  Next: As Sections,  Prev: Secs Background,  Up: Sections

Linker Sections
===============

   `ld' deals with just four kinds of sections, summarized below.

*named sections*
*text section*
*data section*
     These sections hold your program.  `as' and `ld' treat them as
     separate but equal sections.  Anything you can say of one section
     is true another.  When the program is running, however, it is
     customary for the text section to be unalterable.  The text
     section is often shared among processes: it contains instructions,
     constants and the like.  The data section of a running program is
     usually alterable: for example, C variables would be stored in the
     data section.

*bss section*
     This section contains zeroed bytes when your program begins
     running.  It is used to hold uninitialized variables or common
     storage.  The length of each partial program's bss section is
     important, but because it starts out containing zeroed bytes there
     is no need to store explicit zero bytes in the object file.  The
     bss section was invented to eliminate those explicit zeros from
     object files.

*absolute section*
     Address 0 of this section is always "relocated" to runtime address
     0.  This is useful if you want to refer to an address that `ld'
     must not change when relocating.  In this sense we speak of
     absolute addresses being "unrelocatable": they do not change
     during relocation.

*undefined section*
     This "section" is a catch-all for address references to objects
     not in the preceding sections.

   An idealized example of three relocatable sections follows.  The
example uses the traditional section names `.text' and `.data'.  Memory
addresses are on the horizontal axis.

                           +-----+----+--+

                           seg.   seg. seg.
     
                           +---+---+---+

Assembler Internal Sections
===========================

   These sections are meant only for the internal use of `as'.  They
have no meaning at run-time.  You do not really need to know about these
sections for most purposes; but they can be mentioned in `as' warning
messages, so it might be helpful to have an idea of their meanings to
`as'.  These sections are used to permit the value of every expression
in your assembly language program to be a section-relative address.

ASSEMBLER-INTERNAL-LOGIC-ERROR!
     An internal assembler logic error has been found.  This means
     there is a bug in the assembler.

expr section
     The assembler stores complex expression internally as combinations
     of symbols.  When it needs to represent an expression as a symbol,
     it puts it in the expr section.


File: as.info,  Node: Sub-Sections,  Next: bss,  Prev: As Sections,  Up: Sections

Sub-Sections
============

   Assembled bytes conventionally fall into two sections: text and data.
You may have separate groups of data in named sections that you want to
end up near to each other in the object file, even though they are not
contiguous in the assembler source.  `as' allows you to use
"subsections" for this purpose.  Within each section, there can be
numbered subsections with values from 0 to 8192.  Objects assembled
into the same subsection go into the object file together with other
objects in the same subsection.  For example, a compiler might want to
store constants in the text section, but might not want to have them
interspersed with the program being assembled.  In this case, the
compiler could issue a `.text 0' before each section of code being
output, and a `.text 1' before each group of constants being output.

   Subsections are optional.  If you do not use subsections, everything
goes in subsection number zero.

   Each subsection is zero-padded up to a multiple of four bytes.
(Subsections may be padded a different amount on different flavors of
`as'.)

   Subsections appear in your object file in numeric order, lowest
numbered to highest.  (All this to be compatible with other people's
assemblers.)  The object file contains no representation of
subsections; `ld' and other programs that manipulate object files see
no trace of them.  They just see all your text subsections as a text
section, and all your data subsections as a data section.

   To specify which subsection you want subsequent statements assembled
into, use a numeric argument to specify it, in a `.text EXPRESSION' or
a `.data EXPRESSION' statement.  When generating COFF output, you can
also use an extra subsection argument with arbitrary named sections:
`.section NAME, EXPRESSION'.  EXPRESSION should be an absolute
expression.  (*Note Expressions::.)  If you just say `.text' then
`.text 0' is assumed.  Likewise `.data' means `.data 0'.  Assembly
begins in `text 0'.  For instance:
     .text 0     # The default subsection is text 0 anyway.
     .ascii "This lives in the first text subsection. *"
     .text 1
     .ascii "But this lives in the second text subsection."
     .data 0
     .ascii "This lives in the data section,"
     .ascii "in the first data subsection."
     .text 0
     .ascii "This lives in the first text section,"
     .ascii "immediately following the asterisk (*)."

   Each section has a "location counter" incremented by one for every
byte assembled into that section.  Because subsections are merely a
convenience restricted to `as' there is no concept of a subsection
location counter.  There is no way to directly manipulate a location
counter--but the `.align' directive changes it, and any label
definition captures its current value.  The location counter of the
section where statements are being assembled is said to be the "active"
location counter.


File: as.info,  Node: bss,  Prev: Sub-Sections,  Up: Sections

bss Section
===========

   The bss section is used for local common variable storage.  You may
allocate address space in the bss section, but you may not dictate data
to load into it before your program executes.  When your program starts
running, all the contents of the bss section are zeroed bytes.

   The `.lcomm' pseudo-op defines a symbol in the bss section; see
*Note `.lcomm': Lcomm.

   The `.comm' pseudo-op may be used to declare a common symbol, which
is another form of uninitialized symbol; see *Note `.comm': Comm.

   When assembling for a target which supports multiple sections, such
as ELF or COFF, you may switch into the `.bss' section and define
symbols as usual; see *Note `.section': Section.  You may only assemble
zero values into the section.  Typically the section will only contain
symbol definitions and `.skip' directives (*note `.skip': Skip.).

Symbols
*******

   Symbols are a central concept: the programmer uses symbols to name
things, the linker uses symbols to link, and the debugger uses symbols
to debug.

     _Warning:_ `as' does not place symbols in the object file in the
     same order they were declared.  This may break some debuggers.

Labels
======

   A "label" is written as a symbol immediately followed by a colon
`:'.  The symbol then represents the current value of the active
location counter, and is, for example, a suitable instruction operand.
You are warned if you use the same symbol to represent two different
locations: the first definition overrides any other definitions.

   On the HPPA, the usual form for a label need not be immediately
followed by a colon, but instead must start in column zero.  Only one
label may be defined on a single line.  To work around this, the HPPA
version of `as' also provides a special directive `.label' for defining
labels more flexibly.

Giving Symbols Other Values
===========================

   A symbol can be given an arbitrary value by writing a symbol,
followed by an equals sign `=', followed by an expression (*note

*Note `.set': Set.

Symbol Names
============

   Symbol names begin with a letter or with one of `._'.  On most
machines, you can also use `$' in symbol names; exceptions are noted in
*Note Machine Dependencies::.  That character may be followed by any
string of digits, letters, dollar signs (unless otherwise noted in
*Note Machine Dependencies::), and underscores.  For the AMD 29K
family, `?' is also allowed in the body of a symbol name, though not at
its beginning.

   Case of letters is significant: `foo' is a different symbol name
than `Foo'.

   Each symbol has exactly one name.  Each name in an assembly language
program refers to exactly one symbol.  You may use that symbol name any
number of times in a program.

Local Symbol Names
------------------

   Local symbols help compilers and programmers use names temporarily.
They create symbols which are guaranteed to be unique over the entire
scope of the input source code and which can be referred to by a simple
notation.  To define a local symbol, write a label of the form `N:'
(where N represents any positive integer).  To refer to the most recent
previous definition of that symbol write `Nb', using the same number as
when you defined the label.  To refer to the next definition of a local
label, write `Nf'-- The `b' stands for"backwards" and the `f' stands
for "forwards".

   There is no restriction on how you can use these labels, and you can
reuse them too.  So that it is possible to repeatedly define the same
local label (using the same number `N'), although you can only refer to
the most recently defined local label of that number (for a backwards
reference) or the next definition of a specific local label for a
forward reference.  It is also worth noting that the first 10 local
labels (`0:'...`9:') are implemented in a slightly more efficient
manner than the others.

   Here is an example:

     1:        branch 1f
     2:        branch 1b
     1:        branch 2f
     2:        branch 1b

   Which is the equivalent of:

     label_1:  branch label_3
     label_2:  branch label_1
     label_3:  branch label_4
     label_4:  branch label_3

   Local symbol names are only a notational device.  They are
immediately transformed into more conventional symbol names before the
assembler uses them.  The symbol names stored in the symbol table,
appearing in error messages and optionally emitted to the object file.
The names are constructed using these parts:

`L'
     All local labels begin with `L'. Normally both `as' and `ld'
     forget symbols that start with `L'. These labels are used for
     symbols you are never intended to see.  If you use the `-L' option
     then `as' retains these symbols in the object file. If you also
     instruct `ld' to retain these symbols, you may use them in
     debugging.

`NUMBER'
     This is the number that was used in the local label definition.
     So if the label is written `55:' then the number is `55'.

`C-B'
     This unusual character is included so you do not accidentally
     invent a symbol of the same name.  The character has ASCII value
     of `\002' (control-B).

`_ordinal number_'
     This is a serial number to keep the labels distinct.  The first
     definition of `0:' gets the number `1'.  The 15th definition of
     `0:' gets the number `15', and so on.  Likewise the first
     definition of `1:' gets the number `1' and its 15th defintion gets
     `15' as well.

   So for example, the first `1:' is named `L1C-B1', the 44th `3:' is
named `L3C-B44'.

Dollar Local Labels
-------------------

   `as' also supports an even more local form of local labels called
dollar labels.  These labels go out of scope (ie they become undefined)
as soon as a non-local label is defined.  Thus they remain valid for
only a small region of the input source code.  Normal local labels, by
contrast, remain in scope for the entire file, or until they are
redefined by another occurrence of the same local label.

   Dollar labels are defined in exactly the same way as ordinary local
labels, except that instead of being terminated by a colon, they are
terminated by a dollar sign.  eg `55$'.

   They can also be distinguished from ordinary local labels by their
transformed name which uses ASCII character `\001' (control-A) as the
magic character to distinguish them from ordinary labels.  Thus the 5th
defintion of `6$' is named `L6C-A5'.

The Special Dot Symbol
======================

   The special symbol `.' refers to the current address that `as' is
assembling into.  Thus, the expression `melvin: .long .' defines
`melvin' to contain its own address.  Assigning a value to `.' is
treated the same as a `.org' directive.  Thus, the expression `.=.+4'
is the same as saying `.space 4'.

Symbol Attributes
=================

   Every symbol has, as well as its name, the attributes "Value" and
"Type".  Depending on output format, symbols can also have auxiliary
attributes.

   If you use a symbol without defining it, `as' assumes zero for all
these attributes, and probably won't warn you.  This makes the symbol
an externally defined symbol, which is generally what you would want.

Value
-----

   The value of a symbol is (usually) 32 bits.  For a symbol which
labels a location in the text, data, bss or absolute sections the value
is the number of addresses from the start of that section to the label.
Naturally for text, data and bss sections the value of a symbol changes
as `ld' changes section base addresses during linking.  Absolute
symbols' values do not change during linking: that is why they are
called absolute.

   The value of an undefined symbol is treated in a special way.  If it
is 0 then the symbol is not defined in this assembler source file, and
`ld' tries to determine its value from other files linked into the same
program.  You make this kind of symbol simply by mentioning a symbol
name without defining it.  A non-zero value represents a `.comm' common
declaration.  The value is how much common storage to reserve, in bytes
(addresses).  The symbol refers to the first address of the allocated
storage.

Type
----

   The type attribute of a symbol contains relocation (section)
information, any flag settings indicating that a symbol is external, and

Expressions
***********

   An "expression" specifies an address or numeric value.  Whitespace
may precede and/or follow an expression.

   The result of an expression must be an absolute number, or else an
offset into a particular section.  If an expression is not absolute,
and there is not enough information when `as' sees the expression to
know its section, a second pass over the source program might be
necessary to interpret the expression--but the second pass is currently
not implemented.  `as' aborts with an error message in this situation.

Empty Expressions
=================

   An empty expression has no value: it is just whitespace or null.
Wherever an absolute expression is required, you may omit the
expression, and `as' assumes a value of (absolute) 0.  This is
compatible with other assemblers.

   An "integer expression" is one or more _arguments_ delimited by
_operators_.

File: as.info,  Node: Arguments,  Next: Operators,  Up: Integer Exprs

Arguments
---------

   "Arguments" are symbols, numbers or subexpressions.  In other
contexts arguments are sometimes called "arithmetic operands".  In this
manual, to avoid confusing them with the "instruction operands" of the
machine language, we use the term "argument" to refer to parts of
expressions only, reserving the word "operand" to refer only to machine
instruction operands.

   Symbols are evaluated to yield {SECTION NNN} where SECTION is one of
text, data, bss, absolute, or undefined.  NNN is a signed, 2's
complement 32 bit integer.

   Numbers are usually integers.

   A number can be a flonum or bignum.  In this case, you are warned
that only the low order 32 bits are used, and `as' pretends these 32
bits are an integer.  You may write integer-manipulating instructions
that act on exotic constants, compatible with other assemblers.

   Subexpressions are a left parenthesis `(' followed by an integer
expression, followed by a right parenthesis `)'; or a prefix operator
followed by an argument.


File: as.info,  Node: Operators,  Next: Prefix Ops,  Prev: Arguments,  Up: Integer Exprs

Operators
---------

   "Operators" are arithmetic functions, like `+' or `%'.  Prefix
operators are followed by an argument.  Infix operators appear between
their arguments.  Operators may be preceded and/or followed by
whitespace.


File: as.info,  Node: Prefix Ops,  Next: Infix Ops,  Prev: Operators,  Up: Integer Exprs

Prefix Operator
---------------

   `as' has the following "prefix operators".  They each take one
argument, which must be absolute.

`-'
     "Negation".  Two's complement negation.

`~'
     "Complementation".  Bitwise not.


File: as.info,  Node: Infix Ops,  Prev: Prefix Ops,  Up: Integer Exprs

Infix Operators
---------------

   "Infix operators" take two arguments, one on either side.  Operators
have precedence, but operations with equal precedence are performed left
to right.  Apart from `+' or `-', both arguments must be absolute, and
the result is absolute.

  1. Highest Precedence

    `*'
          "Multiplication".

    `/'
          "Division".  Truncation is the same as the C operator `/'

    `%'
          "Remainder".

    `<'
    `<<'
          "Shift Left".  Same as the C operator `<<'.

    `>'
    `>>'
          "Shift Right".  Same as the C operator `>>'.

  2. Intermediate precedence

    `|'
          "Bitwise Inclusive Or".

    `&'
          "Bitwise And".

    `^'
          "Bitwise Exclusive Or".

    `!'
          "Bitwise Or Not".

  3. Low Precedence

    `+'
          "Addition".  If either argument is absolute, the result has
          the section of the other argument.  You may not add together
          arguments from different sections.

    `-'
          "Subtraction".  If the right argument is absolute, the result
          has the section of the left argument.  If both arguments are
          in the same section, the result is absolute.  You may not
          subtract arguments from different sections.

    `=='
          "Is Equal To"

    `<>'
          "Is Not Equal To"

    `<'
          "Is Less Than"

    `>'
          "Is Greater Than"

    `>='
          "Is Greater Than Or Equal To"

    `<='
          "Is Less Than Or Equal To"

          The comparison operators can be used as infix operators.  A
          true results has a value of -1 whereas a false result has a
          value of 0.   Note, these operators perform signed
          comparisons.

  4. Lowest Precedence

    `&&'
          "Logical And".

    `||'
          "Logical Or".

          These two logical operations can be used to combine the
          results of sub expressions.  Note, unlike the comparison
          operators a true result returns a value of 1 but a false
          results does still return 0.  Also note that the logical or
          operator has a slightly lower precedence than logical and.


   In short, it's only meaningful to add or subtract the _offsets_ in an
address; you can only have a defined section in one of the two
arguments.

`.abort'
========

   This directive stops the assembly immediately.  It is for
compatibility with other assemblers.  The original idea was that the
assembly language source would be piped into the assembler.  If the
sender of the source quit, it could use this directive tells `as' to
quit also.  One day `.abort' will not be supported.

`.ABORT'
========

   When producing COFF output, `as' accepts this directive as a synonym
for `.abort'.

   When producing `b.out' output, `as' accepts this directive, but
ignores it.

`.align ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
=====================================

   Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment required, as described below.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The way the required alignment is specified varies from system to
system.  For the a29k, hppa, m68k, m88k, w65, sparc, and Hitachi SH,
and i386 using ELF format, the first expression is the alignment
request in bytes.  For example `.align 8' advances the location counter
until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a
multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   For other systems, including the i386 using a.out format, and the
arm and strongarm, it is the number of low-order zero bits the location
counter must have after advancement.  For example `.align 3' advances
the location counter until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   This inconsistency is due to the different behaviors of the various
native assemblers for these systems which GAS must emulate.  GAS also
provides `.balign' and `.p2align' directives, described later, which
have a consistent behavior across all architectures (but are specific
to GAS).

   `.ascii' expects zero or more string literals (*note Strings::)
separated by commas.  It assembles each string (with no automatic
trailing zero byte) into consecutive addresses.

`.asciz "STRING"'...
====================

   `.asciz' is just like `.ascii', but each string is followed by a
zero byte.  The "z" in `.asciz' stands for "zero".


File: as.info,  Node: Balign,  Next: Byte,  Prev: Asciz,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.balign[wl] ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
==========================================

   Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment request in bytes.  For example `.balign 8' advances the
location counter until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The `.balignw' and `.balignl' directives are variants of the
`.balign' directive.  The `.balignw' directive treats the fill pattern
as a two byte word value.  The `.balignl' directives treats the fill
pattern as a four byte longword value.  For example, `.balignw
4,0x368d' will align to a multiple of 4.  If it skips two bytes, they
will be filled in with the value 0x368d (the exact placement of the
bytes depends upon the endianness of the processor).  If it skips 1 or
3 bytes, the fill value is undefined.

`.byte EXPRESSIONS'
===================

   `.byte' expects zero or more expressions, separated by commas.  Each
expression is assembled into the next byte.


File: as.info,  Node: Comm,  Next: Data,  Prev: Byte,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.comm SYMBOL , LENGTH '
========================

   `.comm' declares a common symbol named SYMBOL.  When linking, a
common symbol in one object file may be merged with a defined or common
symbol of the same name in another object file.  If `ld' does not see a
definition for the symbol-just one or more common symbols-then it will
allocate LENGTH bytes of uninitialized memory.  LENGTH must be an
absolute expression.  If `ld' sees multiple common symbols with the
same name, and they do not all have the same size, it will allocate
space using the largest size.

   When using ELF, the `.comm' directive takes an optional third
argument.  This is the desired alignment of the symbol, specified as a
byte boundary (for example, an alignment of 16 means that the least
significant 4 bits of the address should be zero).  The alignment must
be an absolute expression, and it must be a power of two.  If `ld'
allocates uninitialized memory for the common symbol, it will use the
alignment when placing the symbol.  If no alignment is specified, `as'
will set the alignment to the largest power of two less than or equal
to the size of the symbol, up to a maximum of 16.

   The syntax for `.comm' differs slightly on the HPPA.  The syntax is
`SYMBOL .comm, LENGTH'; SYMBOL is optional.

`.data SUBSECTION'
==================

   `.data' tells `as' to assemble the following statements onto the end
of the data subsection numbered SUBSECTION (which is an absolute
expression).  If SUBSECTION is omitted, it defaults to zero.

=========

   A constant is a number, written so that its value is known by
inspection, without knowing any context.  Like this:

Character Constants
-------------------

   There are two kinds of character constants.  A "character" stands
for one character in one byte and its value may be used in numeric
expressions.  String constants (properly called string _literals_) are
potentially many bytes and their values may not be used in arithmetic
expressions.

Strings
.......

   A "string" is written between double-quotes.  It may contain
double-quotes or null characters.  The way to get special characters
into a string is to "escape" these characters: precede them with a
backslash `\' character.  For example `\\' represents one backslash:
the first `\' is an escape which tells `as' to interpret the second
character literally as a backslash (which prevents `as' from
recognizing the second `\' as an escape character).  The complete list
of escapes follows.

`\b'
     Mnemonic for backspace; for ASCII this is octal code 010.

`\f'
     Mnemonic for FormFeed; for ASCII this is octal code 014.

`\n'
     Mnemonic for newline; for ASCII this is octal code 012.

`\r'
     Mnemonic for carriage-Return; for ASCII this is octal code 015.

`\t'
     Mnemonic for horizontal Tab; for ASCII this is octal code 011.

`\ DIGIT DIGIT DIGIT'
     An octal character code.  The numeric code is 3 octal digits.  For
     compatibility with other Unix systems, 8 and 9 are accepted as
     digits: for example, `\008' has the value 010, and `\009' the
     value 011.

`\`x' HEX-DIGITS...'
     A hex character code.  All trailing hex digits are combined.
     Either upper or lower case `x' works.

`\\'
     Represents one `\' character.

`\"'
     Represents one `"' character.  Needed in strings to represent this
     character, because an unescaped `"' would end the string.

`\ ANYTHING-ELSE'
     Any other character when escaped by `\' gives a warning, but
     assembles as if the `\' was not present.  The idea is that if you
     used an escape sequence you clearly didn't want the literal
     interpretation of the following character.  However `as' has no
     other interpretation, so `as' knows it is giving you the wrong
     code and warns you of the fact.

   Which characters are escapable, and what those escapes represent,
varies widely among assemblers.  The current set is what we think the
BSD 4.2 assembler recognizes, and is a subset of what most C compilers
recognize.  If you are in doubt, do not use an escape sequence.


File: as.info,  Node: Chars,  Prev: Strings,  Up: Characters

Characters
..........

   A single character may be written as a single quote immediately
followed by that character.  The same escapes apply to characters as to
strings.  So if you want to write the character backslash, you must
write `'\\' where the first `\' escapes the second `\'.  As you can
see, the quote is an acute accent, not a grave accent.  A newline
immediately following an acute accent is taken as a literal character
and does not count as the end of a statement.  The value of a character
constant in a numeric expression is the machine's byte-wide code for
that character.  `as' assumes your character code is ASCII: `'A' means
65, `'B' means 66, and so on.

Number Constants
----------------

   `as' distinguishes three kinds of numbers according to how they are
stored in the target machine.  _Integers_ are numbers that would fit
into an `int' in the C language.  _Bignums_ are integers, but they are
stored in more than 32 bits.  _Flonums_ are floating point numbers,
described below.

* Menu:

* Integers::                    Integers
* Bignums::                     Bignums
* Flonums::                     Flonums


File: as.info,  Node: Integers,  Next: Bignums,  Up: Numbers

Integers
........

   A binary integer is `0b' or `0B' followed by zero or more of the
binary digits `01'.

   An octal integer is `0' followed by zero or more of the octal digits
(`01234567').

   A decimal integer starts with a non-zero digit followed by zero or
more digits (`0123456789').

   A hexadecimal integer is `0x' or `0X' followed by one or more
hexadecimal digits chosen from `0123456789abcdefABCDEF'.

   Integers have the usual values.  To denote a negative integer, use
the prefix operator `-' discussed under expressions (*note Prefix
Operators: Prefix Ops.).


File: as.info,  Node: Bignums,  Next: Flonums,  Prev: Integers,  Up: Numbers

Bignums
.......

   A "bignum" has the same syntax and semantics as an integer except
that the number (or its negative) takes more than 32 bits to represent
in binary.  The distinction is made because in some places integers are
permitted while bignums are not.


File: as.info,  Node: Flonums,  Prev: Bignums,  Up: Numbers

Flonums
.......

   A "flonum" represents a floating point number.  The translation is
indirect: a decimal floating point number from the text is converted by
`as' to a generic binary floating point number of more than sufficient
precision.  This generic floating point number is converted to a
particular computer's floating point format (or formats) by a portion
of `as' specialized to that computer.

   A flonum is written by writing (in order)
   * The digit `0'.  (`0' is optional on the HPPA.)

   * A letter, to tell `as' the rest of the number is a flonum.  `e' is
     recommended.  Case is not important.

     On the H8/300, H8/500, Hitachi SH, and AMD 29K architectures, the
     letter must be one of the letters `DFPRSX' (in upper or lower
     case).

     On the ARC, the letter must be one of the letters `DFRS' (in upper
     or lower case).

     On the Intel 960 architecture, the letter must be one of the
     letters `DFT' (in upper or lower case).

     On the HPPA architecture, the letter must be `E' (upper case only).

   * An optional sign: either `+' or `-'.

   * An optional "integer part": zero or more decimal digits.

   * An optional "fractional part": `.' followed by zero or more
     decimal digits.

   * An optional exponent, consisting of:

        * An `E' or `e'.

        * Optional sign: either `+' or `-'.

        * One or more decimal digits.


   At least one of the integer part or the fractional part must be
present.  The floating point number has the usual base-10 value.

   `as' does all processing using integers.  Flonums are computed
independently of any floating point hardware in the computer running
`as'.

Background
==========

   Roughly, a section is a range of addresses, with no gaps; all data
"in" those addresses is treated the same for some particular purpose.
For example there may be a "read only" section.

   The linker `ld' reads many object files (partial programs) and
combines their contents to form a runnable program.  When `as' emits an
object file, the partial program is assumed to start at address 0.
`ld' assigns the final addresses for the partial program, so that
different partial programs do not overlap.  This is actually an
oversimplification, but it suffices to explain how `as' uses sections.

   `ld' moves blocks of bytes of your program to their run-time
addresses.  These blocks slide to their run-time addresses as rigid
units; their length does not change and neither does the order of bytes
within them.  Such a rigid unit is called a _section_.  Assigning
run-time addresses to sections is called "relocation".  It includes the
task of adjusting mentions of object-file addresses so they refer to
the proper run-time addresses.  For the H8/300 and H8/500, and for the
Hitachi SH, `as' pads sections if needed to ensure they end on a word
(sixteen bit) boundary.

   An object file written by `as' has at least three sections, any of
which may be empty.  These are named "text", "data" and "bss" sections.

   When it generates COFF output, `as' can also generate whatever other
named sections you specify using the `.section' directive (*note
`.section': Section.).  If you do not use any directives that place
output in the `.text' or `.data' sections, these sections still exist,
but are empty.

   When `as' generates SOM or ELF output for the HPPA, `as' can also
generate whatever other named sections you specify using the `.space'
and `.subspace' directives.  See `HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language
Reference Manual' (HP 92432-90001) for details on the `.space' and
`.subspace' assembler directives.

   Additionally, `as' uses different names for the standard text, data,
and bss sections when generating SOM output.  Program text is placed
into the `$CODE$' section, data into `$DATA$', and BSS into `$BSS$'.

   Within the object file, the text section starts at address `0', the
data section follows, and the bss section follows the data section.

   When generating either SOM or ELF output files on the HPPA, the text
section starts at address `0', the data section at address `0x4000000',
and the bss section follows the data section.

   To let `ld' know which data changes when the sections are relocated,
and how to change that data, `as' also writes to the object file
details of the relocation needed.  To perform relocation `ld' must
know, each time an address in the object file is mentioned:
   * Where in the object file is the beginning of this reference to an
     address?

   * How long (in bytes) is this reference?

   * Which section does the address refer to?  What is the numeric
     value of
          (ADDRESS) - (START-ADDRESS OF SECTION)?

   * Is the reference to an address "Program-Counter relative"?

   In fact, every address `as' ever uses is expressed as
     (SECTION) + (OFFSET INTO SECTION)

Further, most expressions `as' computes have this section-relative
nature.  (For some object formats, such as SOM for the HPPA, some
expressions are symbol-relative instead.)

   In this manual we use the notation {SECNAME N} to mean "offset N
into section SECNAME."

   Apart from text, data and bss sections you need to know about the
"absolute" section.  When `ld' mixes partial programs, addresses in the
absolute section remain unchanged.  For example, address `{absolute 0}'
is "relocated" to run-time address 0 by `ld'.  Although the linker
never arranges two partial programs' data sections with overlapping
addresses after linking, _by definition_ their absolute sections must
overlap.  Address `{absolute 239}' in one part of a program is always
the same address when the program is running as address `{absolute
239}' in any other part of the program.

   The idea of sections is extended to the "undefined" section.  Any
address whose section is unknown at assembly time is by definition
rendered {undefined U}--where U is filled in later.  Since numbers are
always defined, the only way to generate an undefined address is to
mention an undefined symbol.  A reference to a named common block would
be such a symbol: its value is unknown at assembly time so it has
section _undefined_.

   By analogy the word _section_ is used to describe groups of sections
in the linked program.  `ld' puts all partial programs' text sections
in contiguous addresses in the linked program.  It is customary to
refer to the _text section_ of a program, meaning all the addresses of
all partial programs' text sections.  Likewise for data and bss
sections.

   Some sections are manipulated by `ld'; others are invented for use
of `as' and have no meaning except during assembly.


File: as.info,  Node: Ld Sections,  Next: As Sections,  Prev: Secs Background,  Up: Sections

Linker Sections
===============

   `ld' deals with just four kinds of sections, summarized below.

*named sections*
*text section*
*data section*
     These sections hold your program.  `as' and `ld' treat them as
     separate but equal sections.  Anything you can say of one section
     is true another.  When the program is running, however, it is
     customary for the text section to be unalterable.  The text
     section is often shared among processes: it contains instructions,
     constants and the like.  The data section of a running program is
     usually alterable: for example, C variables would be stored in the
     data section.

*bss section*
     This section contains zeroed bytes when your program begins
     running.  It is used to hold uninitialized variables or common
     storage.  The length of each partial program's bss section is
     important, but because it starts out containing zeroed bytes there
     is no need to store explicit zero bytes in the object file.  The
     bss section was invented to eliminate those explicit zeros from
     object files.

*absolute section*
     Address 0 of this section is always "relocated" to runtime address
     0.  This is useful if you want to refer to an address that `ld'
     must not change when relocating.  In this sense we speak of
     absolute addresses being "unrelocatable": they do not change
     during relocation.

*undefined section*
     This "section" is a catch-all for address references to objects
     not in the preceding sections.

   An idealized example of three relocatable sections follows.  The
example uses the traditional section names `.text' and `.data'.  Memory
addresses are on the horizontal axis.

                           +-----+----+--+
     partial program # 1:  |ttttt|dddd|00|
                           +-----+----+--+
     
                           text   data bss
                           seg.   seg. seg.
     
                           +---+---+---+
     partial program # 2:  |TTT|DDD|000|

Assembler Internal Sections
===========================

   These sections are meant only for the internal use of `as'.  They
have no meaning at run-time.  You do not really need to know about these
sections for most purposes; but they can be mentioned in `as' warning
messages, so it might be helpful to have an idea of their meanings to
`as'.  These sections are used to permit the value of every expression
in your assembly language program to be a section-relative address.

ASSEMBLER-INTERNAL-LOGIC-ERROR!
     An internal assembler logic error has been found.  This means
     there is a bug in the assembler.

expr section
     The assembler stores complex expression internally as combinations
     of symbols.  When it needs to represent an expression as a symbol,
     it puts it in the expr section.


File: as.info,  Node: Sub-Sections,  Next: bss,  Prev: As Sections,  Up: Sections

Sub-Sections
============

   Assembled bytes conventionally fall into two sections: text and data.
You may have separate groups of data in named sections that you want to
end up near to each other in the object file, even though they are not
contiguous in the assembler source.  `as' allows you to use
"subsections" for this purpose.  Within each section, there can be
numbered subsections with values from 0 to 8192.  Objects assembled
into the same subsection go into the object file together with other
objects in the same subsection.  For example, a compiler might want to
store constants in the text section, but might not want to have them
interspersed with the program being assembled.  In this case, the
compiler could issue a `.text 0' before each section of code being
output, and a `.text 1' before each group of constants being output.

   Subsections are optional.  If you do not use subsections, everything
goes in subsection number zero.

   Each subsection is zero-padded up to a multiple of four bytes.
(Subsections may be padded a different amount on different flavors of
`as'.)

   Subsections appear in your object file in numeric order, lowest
numbered to highest.  (All this to be compatible with other people's
assemblers.)  The object file contains no representation of
subsections; `ld' and other programs that manipulate object files see
no trace of them.  They just see all your text subsections as a text
section, and all your data subsections as a data section.

   To specify which subsection you want subsequent statements assembled
into, use a numeric argument to specify it, in a `.text EXPRESSION' or
a `.data EXPRESSION' statement.  When generating COFF output, you can
also use an extra subsection argument with arbitrary named sections:
`.section NAME, EXPRESSION'.  EXPRESSION should be an absolute
expression.  (*Note Expressions::.)  If you just say `.text' then
`.text 0' is assumed.  Likewise `.data' means `.data 0'.  Assembly
begins in `text 0'.  For instance:
     .text 0     # The default subsection is text 0 anyway.
     .ascii "This lives in the first text subsection. *"
     .text 1
     .ascii "But this lives in the second text subsection."
     .data 0
     .ascii "This lives in the data section,"
     .ascii "in the first data subsection."
     .text 0
     .ascii "This lives in the first text section,"
     .ascii "immediately following the asterisk (*)."

   Each section has a "location counter" incremented by one for every
byte assembled into that section.  Because subsections are merely a
convenience restricted to `as' there is no concept of a subsection
location counter.  There is no way to directly manipulate a location
counter--but the `.align' directive changes it, and any label
definition captures its current value.  The location counter of the
section where statements are being assembled is said to be the "active"
location counter.


File: as.info,  Node: bss,  Prev: Sub-Sections,  Up: Sections

bss Section
===========

   The bss section is used for local common variable storage.  You may
allocate address space in the bss section, but you may not dictate data
to load into it before your program executes.  When your program starts
running, all the contents of the bss section are zeroed bytes.

   The `.lcomm' pseudo-op defines a symbol in the bss section; see
*Note `.lcomm': Lcomm.

   The `.comm' pseudo-op may be used to declare a common symbol, which
is another form of uninitialized symbol; see *Note `.comm': Comm.

   When assembling for a target which supports multiple sections, such
as ELF or COFF, you may switch into the `.bss' section and define
symbols as usual; see *Note `.section': Section.  You may only assemble
zero values into the section.  Typically the section will only contain
symbol definitions and `.skip' directives (*note `.skip': Skip.).

Symbols
*******

   Symbols are a central concept: the programmer uses symbols to name
things, the linker uses symbols to link, and the debugger uses symbols
to debug.

     _Warning:_ `as' does not place symbols in the object file in the
     same order they were declared.  This may break some debuggers.

   A "label" is written as a symbol immediately followed by a colon
`:'.  The symbol then represents the current value of the active
location counter, and is, for example, a suitable instruction operand.
You are warned if you use the same symbol to represent two different
locations: the first definition overrides any other definitions.

   On the HPPA, the usual form for a label need not be immediately
followed by a colon, but instead must start in column zero.  Only one
label may be defined on a single line.  To work around this, the HPPA
version of `as' also provides a special directive `.label' for defining
labels more flexibly.

Giving Symbols Other Values
===========================

   A symbol can be given an arbitrary value by writing a symbol,
followed by an equals sign `=', followed by an expression (*note
Expressions::).  This is equivalent to using the `.set' directive.
*Note `.set': Set.

Symbol Names
============

   Symbol names begin with a letter or with one of `._'.  On most
machines, you can also use `$' in symbol names; exceptions are noted in
*Note Machine Dependencies::.  That character may be followed by any
string of digits, letters, dollar signs (unless otherwise noted in
*Note Machine Dependencies::), and underscores.  For the AMD 29K
family, `?' is also allowed in the body of a symbol name, though not at
its beginning.

   Case of letters is significant: `foo' is a different symbol name
than `Foo'.

   Each symbol has exactly one name.  Each name in an assembly language
program refers to exactly one symbol.  You may use that symbol name any
number of times in a program.

Local Symbol Names
------------------

   Local symbols help compilers and programmers use names temporarily.
They create symbols which are guaranteed to be unique over the entire
scope of the input source code and which can be referred to by a simple
notation.  To define a local symbol, write a label of the form `N:'
(where N represents any positive integer).  To refer to the most recent
previous definition of that symbol write `Nb', using the same number as
when you defined the label.  To refer to the next definition of a local
label, write `Nf'-- The `b' stands for"backwards" and the `f' stands
for "forwards".

   There is no restriction on how you can use these labels, and you can
reuse them too.  So that it is possible to repeatedly define the same
local label (using the same number `N'), although you can only refer to
the most recently defined local label of that number (for a backwards
reference) or the next definition of a specific local label for a
forward reference.  It is also worth noting that the first 10 local
labels (`0:'...`9:') are implemented in a slightly more efficient
manner than the others.

   Here is an example:

     1:        branch 1f
     2:        branch 1b
     1:        branch 2f
     2:        branch 1b

   Which is the equivalent of:

     label_1:  branch label_3
     label_2:  branch label_1
     label_3:  branch label_4
     label_4:  branch label_3

   Local symbol names are only a notational device.  They are
immediately transformed into more conventional symbol names before the
assembler uses them.  The symbol names stored in the symbol table,
appearing in error messages and optionally emitted to the object file.
The names are constructed using these parts:

`L'
     All local labels begin with `L'. Normally both `as' and `ld'
     forget symbols that start with `L'. These labels are used for
     symbols you are never intended to see.  If you use the `-L' option
     then `as' retains these symbols in the object file. If you also
     instruct `ld' to retain these symbols, you may use them in
     debugging.

`NUMBER'
     This is the number that was used in the local label definition.
     So if the label is written `55:' then the number is `55'.

`C-B'
     This unusual character is included so you do not accidentally
     invent a symbol of the same name.  The character has ASCII value
     of `\002' (control-B).

`_ordinal number_'
     This is a serial number to keep the labels distinct.  The first
     definition of `0:' gets the number `1'.  The 15th definition of
     `0:' gets the number `15', and so on.  Likewise the first
     definition of `1:' gets the number `1' and its 15th defintion gets
     `15' as well.

   So for example, the first `1:' is named `L1C-B1', the 44th `3:' is
named `L3C-B44'.

Dollar Local Labels
-------------------

   `as' also supports an even more local form of local labels called
dollar labels.  These labels go out of scope (ie they become undefined)
as soon as a non-local label is defined.  Thus they remain valid for
only a small region of the input source code.  Normal local labels, by
contrast, remain in scope for the entire file, or until they are
redefined by another occurrence of the same local label.

   Dollar labels are defined in exactly the same way as ordinary local
labels, except that instead of being terminated by a colon, they are
terminated by a dollar sign.  eg `55$'.

   They can also be distinguished from ordinary local labels by their
transformed name which uses ASCII character `\001' (control-A) as the
magic character to distinguish them from ordinary labels.  Thus the 5th
defintion of `6$' is named `L6C-A5'.

The Special Dot Symbol
======================

   The special symbol `.' refers to the current address that `as' is
assembling into.  Thus, the expression `melvin: .long .' defines
`melvin' to contain its own address.  Assigning a value to `.' is
treated the same as a `.org' directive.  Thus, the expression `.=.+4'
is the same as saying `.space 4'.

Symbol Attributes
=================

   Every symbol has, as well as its name, the attributes "Value" and
"Type".  Depending on output format, symbols can also have auxiliary
attributes.

   If you use a symbol without defining it, `as' assumes zero for all
these attributes, and probably won't warn you.  This makes the symbol
an externally defined symbol, which is generally what you would want.

Value
-----

   The value of a symbol is (usually) 32 bits.  For a symbol which
labels a location in the text, data, bss or absolute sections the value
is the number of addresses from the start of that section to the label.
Naturally for text, data and bss sections the value of a symbol changes
as `ld' changes section base addresses during linking.  Absolute
symbols' values do not change during linking: that is why they are
called absolute.

   The value of an undefined symbol is treated in a special way.  If it
is 0 then the symbol is not defined in this assembler source file, and
`ld' tries to determine its value from other files linked into the same
program.  You make this kind of symbol simply by mentioning a symbol
name without defining it.  A non-zero value represents a `.comm' common
declaration.  The value is how much common storage to reserve, in bytes
(addresses).  The symbol refers to the first address of the allocated
storage.

Type
----

   The type attribute of a symbol contains relocation (section)
information, any flag settings indicating that a symbol is external, and
(optionally), other information for linkers and debuggers.  The exact
format depends on the object-code output format in use.

Expressions
***********

   An "expression" specifies an address or numeric value.  Whitespace
may precede and/or follow an expression.

   The result of an expression must be an absolute number, or else an
offset into a particular section.  If an expression is not absolute,
and there is not enough information when `as' sees the expression to
know its section, a second pass over the source program might be
necessary to interpret the expression--but the second pass is currently
not implemented.  `as' aborts with an error message in this situation.

File: as.info,  Node: Empty Exprs,  Next: Integer Exprs,  Up: Expressions

Empty Expressions
=================

   An empty expression has no value: it is just whitespace or null.
Wherever an absolute expression is required, you may omit the
expression, and `as' assumes a value of (absolute) 0.  This is
compatible with other assemblers.

Integer Expressions

   An "integer expression" is one or more _arguments_ delimited by
_operators_.

File: as.info,  Node: Arguments,  Next: Operators,  Up: Integer Exprs

Arguments
---------

   "Arguments" are symbols, numbers or subexpressions.  In other
contexts arguments are sometimes called "arithmetic operands".  In this
manual, to avoid confusing them with the "instruction operands" of the
machine language, we use the term "argument" to refer to parts of
expressions only, reserving the word "operand" to refer only to machine
instruction operands.

   Symbols are evaluated to yield {SECTION NNN} where SECTION is one of
text, data, bss, absolute, or undefined.  NNN is a signed, 2's
complement 32 bit integer.

   Numbers are usually integers.

   A number can be a flonum or bignum.  In this case, you are warned
that only the low order 32 bits are used, and `as' pretends these 32
bits are an integer.  You may write integer-manipulating instructions
that act on exotic constants, compatible with other assemblers.

   Subexpressions are a left parenthesis `(' followed by an integer
expression, followed by a right parenthesis `)'; or a prefix operator
followed by an argument.


File: as.info,  Node: Operators,  Next: Prefix Ops,  Prev: Arguments,  Up: Integer Exprs

Operators
---------

   "Operators" are arithmetic functions, like `+' or `%'.  Prefix
operators are followed by an argument.  Infix operators appear between
their arguments.  Operators may be preceded and/or followed by
whitespace.


File: as.info,  Node: Prefix Ops,  Next: Infix Ops,  Prev: Operators,  Up: Integer Exprs

Prefix Operator
---------------

   `as' has the following "prefix operators".  They each take one
argument, which must be absolute.

`-'
     "Negation".  Two's complement negation.

`~'
     "Complementation".  Bitwise not.


File: as.info,  Node: Infix Ops,  Prev: Prefix Ops,  Up: Integer Exprs

Infix Operators
---------------

   "Infix operators" take two arguments, one on either side.  Operators
have precedence, but operations with equal precedence are performed left
to right.  Apart from `+' or `-', both arguments must be absolute, and
the result is absolute.

  1. Highest Precedence

    `*'
          "Multiplication".

    `/'
          "Division".  Truncation is the same as the C operator `/'

    `%'
          "Remainder".

    `<'
    `<<'
          "Shift Left".  Same as the C operator `<<'.

    `>'
    `>>'
          "Shift Right".  Same as the C operator `>>'.

  2. Intermediate precedence

    `|'
          "Bitwise Inclusive Or".

    `&'
          "Bitwise And".

    `^'
          "Bitwise Exclusive Or".

    `!'
          "Bitwise Or Not".

  3. Low Precedence

    `+'
          "Addition".  If either argument is absolute, the result has
          the section of the other argument.  You may not add together
          arguments from different sections.

    `-'
          "Subtraction".  If the right argument is absolute, the result
          has the section of the left argument.  If both arguments are
          in the same section, the result is absolute.  You may not
          subtract arguments from different sections.

    `=='
          "Is Equal To"

    `<>'
          "Is Not Equal To"

    `<'
          "Is Less Than"

    `>'
          "Is Greater Than"

    `>='
          "Is Greater Than Or Equal To"

    `<='
          "Is Less Than Or Equal To"

          The comparison operators can be used as infix operators.  A
          true results has a value of -1 whereas a false result has a
          value of 0.   Note, these operators perform signed
          comparisons.

  4. Lowest Precedence

    `&&'
          "Logical And".

    `||'
          "Logical Or".

          These two logical operations can be used to combine the
          results of sub expressions.  Note, unlike the comparison
          operators a true result returns a value of 1 but a false
          results does still return 0.  Also note that the logical or
          operator has a slightly lower precedence than logical and.


   In short, it's only meaningful to add or subtract the _offsets_ in an
address; you can only have a defined section in one of the two
arguments.

`.abort'
========

   This directive stops the assembly immediately.  It is for
compatibility with other assemblers.  The original idea was that the
assembly language source would be piped into the assembler.  If the
sender of the source quit, it could use this directive tells `as' to
quit also.  One day `.abort' will not be supported.

`.align ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
=====================================

   Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment required, as described below.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The way the required alignment is specified varies from system to
system.  For the a29k, hppa, m68k, m88k, w65, sparc, and Hitachi SH,
and i386 using ELF format, the first expression is the alignment
request in bytes.  For example `.align 8' advances the location counter
until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a
multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   For other systems, including the i386 using a.out format, and the
arm and strongarm, it is the number of low-order zero bits the location
counter must have after advancement.  For example `.align 3' advances
the location counter until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   This inconsistency is due to the different behaviors of the various
native assemblers for these systems which GAS must emulate.  GAS also
provides `.balign' and `.p2align' directives, described later, which
have a consistent behavior across all architectures (but are specific
to GAS).

`.ascii "STRING"'...
====================

   `.ascii' expects zero or more string literals (*note Strings::)
separated by commas.  It assembles each string (with no automatic
trailing zero byte) into consecutive addresses.


File: as.info,  Node: Asciz,  Next: Balign,  Prev: Ascii,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.asciz "STRING"'...
====================

   `.asciz' is just like `.ascii', but each string is followed by a
zero byte.  The "z" in `.asciz' stands for "zero".


File: as.info,  Node: Balign,  Next: Byte,  Prev: Asciz,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.balign[wl] ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
==========================================

   Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment request in bytes.  For example `.balign 8' advances the
location counter until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The `.balignw' and `.balignl' directives are variants of the
`.balign' directive.  The `.balignw' directive treats the fill pattern
as a two byte word value.  The `.balignl' directives treats the fill
pattern as a four byte longword value.  For example, `.balignw
4,0x368d' will align to a multiple of 4.  If it skips two bytes, they
will be filled in with the value 0x368d (the exact placement of the
bytes depends upon the endianness of the processor).  If it skips 1 or
3 bytes, the fill value is undefined.

`.byte EXPRESSIONS'
===================

   `.byte' expects zero or more expressions, separated by commas.  Each
expression is assembled into the next byte.


File: as.info,  Node: Comm,  Next: Data,  Prev: Byte,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.comm SYMBOL , LENGTH '
========================

   `.comm' declares a common symbol named SYMBOL.  When linking, a
common symbol in one object file may be merged with a defined or common
symbol of the same name in another object file.  If `ld' does not see a
definition for the symbol-just one or more common symbols-then it will
allocate LENGTH bytes of uninitialized memory.  LENGTH must be an
absolute expression.  If `ld' sees multiple common symbols with the
same name, and they do not all have the same size, it will allocate
space using the largest size.

   When using ELF, the `.comm' directive takes an optional third
argument.  This is the desired alignment of the symbol, specified as a
byte boundary (for example, an alignment of 16 means that the least
significant 4 bits of the address should be zero).  The alignment must
be an absolute expression, and it must be a power of two.  If `ld'
allocates uninitialized memory for the common symbol, it will use the
alignment when placing the symbol.  If no alignment is specified, `as'
will set the alignment to the largest power of two less than or equal
to the size of the symbol, up to a maximum of 16.

   The syntax for `.comm' differs slightly on the HPPA.  The syntax is
`SYMBOL .comm, LENGTH'; SYMBOL is optional.


File: as.info,  Node: Data,  Next: Def,  Prev: Comm,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.data SUBSECTION'
==================

   `.data' tells `as' to assemble the following statements onto the end
of the data subsection numbered SUBSECTION (which is an absolute
expression).  If SUBSECTION is omitted, it defaults to zero.


File: as.info,  Node: Def,  Next: Desc,  Prev: Data,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.def NAME'
===========

   Begin defining debugging information for a symbol NAME; the
definition extends until the `.endef' directive is encountered.

   This directive is only observed when `as' is configured for COFF
format output; when producing `b.out', `.def' is recognized, but
ignored.


File: as.info,  Node: Desc,  Next: Dim,  Prev: Def,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.desc SYMBOL, ABS-EXPRESSION'
==============================

   This directive sets the descriptor of the symbol (*note Symbol
Attributes::) to the low 16 bits of an absolute expression.

   The `.desc' directive is not available when `as' is configured for
COFF output; it is only for `a.out' or `b.out' object format.  For the
sake of compatibility, `as' accepts it, but produces no output, when
configured for COFF.


File: as.info,  Node: Dim,  Next: Double,  Prev: Desc,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.dim'
======

   This directive is generated by compilers to include auxiliary
debugging information in the symbol table.  It is only permitted inside
`.def'/`.endef' pairs.

   `.dim' is only meaningful when generating COFF format output; when
`as' is generating `b.out', it accepts this directive but ignores it.


File: as.info,  Node: Double,  Next: Eject,  Prev: Dim,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.double FLONUMS'
=================

   `.double' expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas.  It
assembles floating point numbers.  The exact kind of floating point
numbers emitted depends on how `as' is configured.  *Note Machine
Dependencies::.

Bignums
.......

   A "bignum" has the same syntax and semantics as an integer except
that the number (or its negative) takes more than 32 bits to represent
in binary.  The distinction is made because in some places integers are
permitted while bignums are not.


File: as.info,  Node: Flonums,  Prev: Bignums,  Up: Numbers

Flonums
.......

   A "flonum" represents a floating point number.  The translation is
indirect: a decimal floating point number from the text is converted by
`as' to a generic binary floating point number of more than sufficient
precision.  This generic floating point number is converted to a
particular computer's floating point format (or formats) by a portion
of `as' specialized to that computer.

   A flonum is written by writing (in order)
   * The digit `0'.  (`0' is optional on the HPPA.)

   * A letter, to tell `as' the rest of the number is a flonum.  `e' is
     recommended.  Case is not important.

     On the H8/300, H8/500, Hitachi SH, and AMD 29K architectures, the
     letter must be one of the letters `DFPRSX' (in upper or lower
     case).

     On the ARC, the letter must be one of the letters `DFRS' (in upper
     or lower case).

     On the Intel 960 architecture, the letter must be one of the
     letters `DFT' (in upper or lower case).

     On the HPPA architecture, the letter must be `E' (upper case only).

   * An optional sign: either `+' or `-'.

   * An optional "integer part": zero or more decimal digits.

   * An optional "fractional part": `.' followed by zero or more
     decimal digits.

   * An optional exponent, consisting of:

        * An `E' or `e'.

        * Optional sign: either `+' or `-'.

        * One or more decimal digits.


   At least one of the integer part or the fractional part must be
present.  The floating point number has the usual base-10 value.

   `as' does all processing using integers.  Flonums are computed
independently of any floating point hardware in the computer running
`as'.

Background
==========

   Roughly, a section is a range of addresses, with no gaps; all data
"in" those addresses is treated the same for some particular purpose.
For example there may be a "read only" section.

   The linker `ld' reads many object files (partial programs) and
combines their contents to form a runnable program.  When `as' emits an
object file, the partial program is assumed to start at address 0.
`ld' assigns the final addresses for the partial program, so that
different partial programs do not overlap.  This is actually an
oversimplification, but it suffices to explain how `as' uses sections.

   `ld' moves blocks of bytes of your program to their run-time
addresses.  These blocks slide to their run-time addresses as rigid
units; their length does not change and neither does the order of bytes
within them.  Such a rigid unit is called a _section_.  Assigning
run-time addresses to sections is called "relocation".  It includes the
task of adjusting mentions of object-file addresses so they refer to
the proper run-time addresses.  For the H8/300 and H8/500, and for the
Hitachi SH, `as' pads sections if needed to ensure they end on a word
(sixteen bit) boundary.

   An object file written by `as' has at least three sections, any of
which may be empty.  These are named "text", "data" and "bss" sections.

   When it generates COFF output, `as' can also generate whatever other
named sections you specify using the `.section' directive (*note
`.section': Section.).  If you do not use any directives that place
output in the `.text' or `.data' sections, these sections still exist,
but are empty.

   When `as' generates SOM or ELF output for the HPPA, `as' can also
generate whatever other named sections you specify using the `.space'
and `.subspace' directives.  See `HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language
Reference Manual' (HP 92432-90001) for details on the `.space' and
`.subspace' assembler directives.

   Additionally, `as' uses different names for the standard text, data,
and bss sections when generating SOM output.  Program text is placed
into the `$CODE$' section, data into `$DATA$', and BSS into `$BSS$'.

   Within the object file, the text section starts at address `0', the
data section follows, and the bss section follows the data section.

   When generating either SOM or ELF output files on the HPPA, the text
section starts at address `0', the data section at address `0x4000000',
and the bss section follows the data section.

   To let `ld' know which data changes when the sections are relocated,
and how to change that data, `as' also writes to the object file
details of the relocation needed.  To perform relocation `ld' must
know, each time an address in the object file is mentioned:
   * Where in the object file is the beginning of this reference to an
     address?

   * How long (in bytes) is this reference?

   * Which section does the address refer to?  What is the numeric
     value of
          (ADDRESS) - (START-ADDRESS OF SECTION)?

   * Is the reference to an address "Program-Counter relative"?

   In fact, every address `as' ever uses is expressed as
     (SECTION) + (OFFSET INTO SECTION)

Further, most expressions `as' computes have this section-relative
nature.  (For some object formats, such as SOM for the HPPA, some
expressions are symbol-relative instead.)

   In this manual we use the notation {SECNAME N} to mean "offset N
into section SECNAME."

   Apart from text, data and bss sections you need to know about the
"absolute" section.  When `ld' mixes partial programs, addresses in the
absolute section remain unchanged.  For example, address `{absolute 0}'
is "relocated" to run-time address 0 by `ld'.  Although the linker
never arranges two partial programs' data sections with overlapping
addresses after linking, _by definition_ their absolute sections must
overlap.  Address `{absolute 239}' in one part of a program is always
the same address when the program is running as address `{absolute
239}' in any other part of the program.

   The idea of sections is extended to the "undefined" section.  Any
address whose section is unknown at assembly time is by definition
rendered {undefined U}--where U is filled in later.  Since numbers are
always defined, the only way to generate an undefined address is to
mention an undefined symbol.  A reference to a named common block would
be such a symbol: its value is unknown at assembly time so it has
section _undefined_.

   By analogy the word _section_ is used to describe groups of sections
in the linked program.  `ld' puts all partial programs' text sections
in contiguous addresses in the linked program.  It is customary to
refer to the _text section_ of a program, meaning all the addresses of
all partial programs' text sections.  Likewise for data and bss
sections.

   Some sections are manipulated by `ld'; others are invented for use
of `as' and have no meaning except during assembly.


File: as.info,  Node: Ld Sections,  Next: As Sections,  Prev: Secs Background,  Up: Sections

Linker Sections
===============

   `ld' deals with just four kinds of sections, summarized below.

*named sections*
*text section*
*data section*
     These sections hold your program.  `as' and `ld' treat them as
     separate but equal sections.  Anything you can say of one section
     is true another.  When the program is running, however, it is
     customary for the text section to be unalterable.  The text
     section is often shared among processes: it contains instructions,
     constants and the like.  The data section of a running program is
     usually alterable: for example, C variables would be stored in the
     data section.

*bss section*
     This section contains zeroed bytes when your program begins
     running.  It is used to hold uninitialized variables or common
     storage.  The length of each partial program's bss section is
     important, but because it starts out containing zeroed bytes there
     is no need to store explicit zero bytes in the object file.  The
     bss section was invented to eliminate those explicit zeros from
     object files.

*absolute section*
     Address 0 of this section is always "relocated" to runtime address
     0.  This is useful if you want to refer to an address that `ld'
     must not change when relocating.  In this sense we speak of
     absolute addresses being "unrelocatable": they do not change
     during relocation.

*undefined section*
     This "section" is a catch-all for address references to objects
     not in the preceding sections.

   An idealized example of three relocatable sections follows.  The
example uses the traditional section names `.text' and `.data'.  Memory
addresses are on the horizontal axis.

                           +-----+----+--+
     partial program # 1:  |ttttt|dddd|00|
                           +-----+----+--+
     
                           text   data bss
                           seg.   seg. seg.
     
                           +---+---+---+
     partial program # 2:  |TTT|DDD|000|
                           +---+---+---+
     
                           +--+---+-----+--+----+---+-----+~~
     linked program:       |  |TTT|ttttt|  |dddd|DDD|00000|
                           +--+---+-----+--+----+---+-----+~~
     
         addresses:        0 ...

Assembler Internal Sections
===========================

   These sections are meant only for the internal use of `as'.  They
have no meaning at run-time.  You do not really need to know about these
sections for most purposes; but they can be mentioned in `as' warning
messages, so it might be helpful to have an idea of their meanings to
`as'.  These sections are used to permit the value of every expression
in your assembly language program to be a section-relative address.

ASSEMBLER-INTERNAL-LOGIC-ERROR!
     An internal assembler logic error has been found.  This means
     there is a bug in the assembler.

expr section
     The assembler stores complex expression internally as combinations
     of symbols.  When it needs to represent an expression as a symbol,
     it puts it in the expr section.


File: as.info,  Node: Sub-Sections,  Next: bss,  Prev: As Sections,  Up: Sections

Sub-Sections
============

   Assembled bytes conventionally fall into two sections: text and data.
You may have separate groups of data in named sections that you want to
end up near to each other in the object file, even though they are not
contiguous in the assembler source.  `as' allows you to use
"subsections" for this purpose.  Within each section, there can be
numbered subsections with values from 0 to 8192.  Objects assembled
into the same subsection go into the object file together with other
objects in the same subsection.  For example, a compiler might want to
store constants in the text section, but might not want to have them
interspersed with the program being assembled.  In this case, the
compiler could issue a `.text 0' before each section of code being
output, and a `.text 1' before each group of constants being output.

   Subsections are optional.  If you do not use subsections, everything
goes in subsection number zero.

   Each subsection is zero-padded up to a multiple of four bytes.
(Subsections may be padded a different amount on different flavors of
`as'.)

   Subsections appear in your object file in numeric order, lowest
numbered to highest.  (All this to be compatible with other people's
assemblers.)  The object file contains no representation of
subsections; `ld' and other programs that manipulate object files see
no trace of them.  They just see all your text subsections as a text
section, and all your data subsections as a data section.

   To specify which subsection you want subsequent statements assembled
into, use a numeric argument to specify it, in a `.text EXPRESSION' or
a `.data EXPRESSION' statement.  When generating COFF output, you can
also use an extra subsection argument with arbitrary named sections:
`.section NAME, EXPRESSION'.  EXPRESSION should be an absolute
expression.  (*Note Expressions::.)  If you just say `.text' then
`.text 0' is assumed.  Likewise `.data' means `.data 0'.  Assembly
begins in `text 0'.  For instance:
     .text 0     # The default subsection is text 0 anyway.
     .ascii "This lives in the first text subsection. *"
     .text 1
     .ascii "But this lives in the second text subsection."
     .data 0
     .ascii "This lives in the data section,"
     .ascii "in the first data subsection."
     .text 0
     .ascii "This lives in the first text section,"
     .ascii "immediately following the asterisk (*)."

   Each section has a "location counter" incremented by one for every
byte assembled into that section.  Because subsections are merely a
convenience restricted to `as' there is no concept of a subsection
location counter.  There is no way to directly manipulate a location
counter--but the `.align' directive changes it, and any label
definition captures its current value.  The location counter of the
section where statements are being assembled is said to be the "active"
location counter.


File: as.info,  Node: bss,  Prev: Sub-Sections,  Up: Sections

bss Section
===========

   The bss section is used for local common variable storage.  You may
allocate address space in the bss section, but you may not dictate data
to load into it before your program executes.  When your program starts
running, all the contents of the bss section are zeroed bytes.

   The `.lcomm' pseudo-op defines a symbol in the bss section; see
*Note `.lcomm': Lcomm.

   The `.comm' pseudo-op may be used to declare a common symbol, which
is another form of uninitialized symbol; see *Note `.comm': Comm.

   When assembling for a target which supports multiple sections, such
as ELF or COFF, you may switch into the `.bss' section and define
symbols as usual; see *Note `.section': Section.  You may only assemble
zero values into the section.  Typically the section will only contain
symbol definitions and `.skip' directives (*note `.skip': Skip.).


File: as.info,  Node: Symbols,  Next: Expressions,  Prev: Sections,  Up: Top

Symbols
*******

   Symbols are a central concept: the programmer uses symbols to name
things, the linker uses symbols to link, and the debugger uses symbols
to debug.

     _Warning:_ `as' does not place symbols in the object file in the
     same order they were declared.  This may break some debuggers.

Labels
======

   A "label" is written as a symbol immediately followed by a colon
`:'.  The symbol then represents the current value of the active
location counter, and is, for example, a suitable instruction operand.
You are warned if you use the same symbol to represent two different
locations: the first definition overrides any other definitions.

   On the HPPA, the usual form for a label need not be immediately
followed by a colon, but instead must start in column zero.  Only one
label may be defined on a single line.  To work around this, the HPPA
version of `as' also provides a special directive `.label' for defining
labels more flexibly.


File: as.info,  Node: Setting Symbols,  Next: Symbol Names,  Prev: Labels,  Up: Symbols

Giving Symbols Other Values
===========================

   A symbol can be given an arbitrary value by writing a symbol,
followed by an equals sign `=', followed by an expression (*note
Expressions::).  This is equivalent to using the `.set' directive.
*Note `.set': Set.


File: as.info,  Node: Symbol Names,  Next: Dot,  Prev: Setting Symbols,  Up: Symbols

Symbol Names
============

   Symbol names begin with a letter or with one of `._'.  On most
machines, you can also use `$' in symbol names; exceptions are noted in
*Note Machine Dependencies::.  That character may be followed by any
string of digits, letters, dollar signs (unless otherwise noted in
*Note Machine Dependencies::), and underscores.  For the AMD 29K
family, `?' is also allowed in the body of a symbol name, though not at
its beginning.

   Case of letters is significant: `foo' is a different symbol name
than `Foo'.

   Each symbol has exactly one name.  Each name in an assembly language
program refers to exactly one symbol.  You may use that symbol name any
number of times in a program.

Local Symbol Names
------------------

   Local symbols help compilers and programmers use names temporarily.
There are ten local symbol names, which are re-used throughout the
program.  You may refer to them using the names `0' `1' ... `9'.  To
define a local symbol, write a label of the form `N:' (where N
represents any digit).  To refer to the most recent previous definition
of that symbol write `Nb', using the same digit as when you defined the
label.  To refer to the next definition of a local label, write
`Nf'--where N gives you a choice of 10 forward references.  The `b'
stands for "backwards" and the `f' stands for "forwards".

   Local symbols are not emitted by the current GNU C compiler.

   There is no restriction on how you can use these labels, but
remember that at any point in the assembly you can refer to at most 10
prior local labels and to at most 10 forward local labels.

   Local symbol names are only a notation device.  They are immediately
transformed into more conventional symbol names before the assembler
uses them.  The symbol names stored in the symbol table, appearing in
error messages and optionally emitted to the object file have these
parts:

`L'
     All local labels begin with `L'. Normally both `as' and `ld'
     forget symbols that start with `L'. These labels are used for
     symbols you are never intended to see.  If you use the `-L' option
     then `as' retains these symbols in the object file. If you also
     instruct `ld' to retain these symbols, you may use them in
     debugging.

`DIGIT'
     If the label is written `0:' then the digit is `0'.  If the label
     is written `1:' then the digit is `1'.  And so on up through `9:'.

`C-A'
     This unusual character is included so you do not accidentally
     invent a symbol of the same name.  The character has ASCII value
     `\001'.

`_ordinal number_'
     This is a serial number to keep the labels distinct.  The first
     `0:' gets the number `1'; The 15th `0:' gets the number `15';
     _etc._.  Likewise for the other labels `1:' through `9:'.

   For instance, the first `1:' is named `L1C-A1', the 44th `3:' is
named `L3C-A44'.

The Special Dot Symbol
======================

   The special symbol `.' refers to the current address that `as' is
assembling into.  Thus, the expression `melvin: .long .' defines
`melvin' to contain its own address.  Assigning a value to `.' is
treated the same as a `.org' directive.  Thus, the expression `.=.+4'
is the same as saying `.space 4'.

Symbol Attributes
=================

   Every symbol has, as well as its name, the attributes "Value" and
"Type".  Depending on output format, symbols can also have auxiliary
attributes.

   If you use a symbol without defining it, `as' assumes zero for all
these attributes, and probably won't warn you.  This makes the symbol
an externally defined symbol, which is generally what you would want.

Value
-----

   The value of a symbol is (usually) 32 bits.  For a symbol which
labels a location in the text, data, bss or absolute sections the value
is the number of addresses from the start of that section to the label.
Naturally for text, data and bss sections the value of a symbol changes
as `ld' changes section base addresses during linking.  Absolute
symbols' values do not change during linking: that is why they are
called absolute.

   The value of an undefined symbol is treated in a special way.  If it
is 0 then the symbol is not defined in this assembler source file, and
`ld' tries to determine its value from other files linked into the same
program.  You make this kind of symbol simply by mentioning a symbol
name without defining it.  A non-zero value represents a `.comm' common
declaration.  The value is how much common storage to reserve, in bytes
(addresses).  The symbol refers to the first address of the allocated
storage.

Type
----

   The type attribute of a symbol contains relocation (section)
information, any flag settings indicating that a symbol is external, and
(optionally), other information for linkers and debuggers.  The exact

Expressions
***********

   An "expression" specifies an address or numeric value.  Whitespace
may precede and/or follow an expression.

   The result of an expression must be an absolute number, or else an
offset into a particular section.  If an expression is not absolute,
and there is not enough information when `as' sees the expression to
know its section, a second pass over the source program might be
necessary to interpret the expression--but the second pass is currently
not implemented.  `as' aborts with an error message in this situation.

File: as.info,  Node: Empty Exprs,  Next: Integer Exprs,  Up: Expressions

Empty Expressions
=================

   An empty expression has no value: it is just whitespace or null.
Wherever an absolute expression is required, you may omit the
expression, and `as' assumes a value of (absolute) 0.  This is
compatible with other assemblers.


File: as.info,  Node: Integer Exprs,  Prev: Empty Exprs,  Up: Expressions

Integer Expressions
===================

   An "integer expression" is one or more _arguments_ delimited by
_operators_.

File: as.info,  Node: Arguments,  Next: Operators,  Up: Integer Exprs

Arguments
---------

   "Arguments" are symbols, numbers or subexpressions.  In other
contexts arguments are sometimes called "arithmetic operands".  In this
manual, to avoid confusing them with the "instruction operands" of the
machine language, we use the term "argument" to refer to parts of
expressions only, reserving the word "operand" to refer only to machine
instruction operands.

   Symbols are evaluated to yield {SECTION NNN} where SECTION is one of
text, data, bss, absolute, or undefined.  NNN is a signed, 2's
complement 32 bit integer.

   Numbers are usually integers.

   A number can be a flonum or bignum.  In this case, you are warned
that only the low order 32 bits are used, and `as' pretends these 32
bits are an integer.  You may write integer-manipulating instructions
that act on exotic constants, compatible with other assemblers.

   Subexpressions are a left parenthesis `(' followed by an integer
expression, followed by a right parenthesis `)'; or a prefix operator
followed by an argument.


File: as.info,  Node: Operators,  Next: Prefix Ops,  Prev: Arguments,  Up: Integer Exprs

Operators
---------

   "Operators" are arithmetic functions, like `+' or `%'.  Prefix
operators are followed by an argument.  Infix operators appear between
their arguments.  Operators may be preceded and/or followed by
whitespace.


File: as.info,  Node: Prefix Ops,  Next: Infix Ops,  Prev: Operators,  Up: Integer Exprs

Prefix Operator
---------------

   `as' has the following "prefix operators".  They each take one
argument, which must be absolute.

`-'
     "Negation".  Two's complement negation.

`~'
     "Complementation".  Bitwise not.


File: as.info,  Node: Infix Ops,  Prev: Prefix Ops,  Up: Integer Exprs

Infix Operators
---------------

   "Infix operators" take two arguments, one on either side.  Operators
have precedence, but operations with equal precedence are performed left
to right.  Apart from `+' or `-', both arguments must be absolute, and
the result is absolute.

  1. Highest Precedence

    `*'
          "Multiplication".

    `/'
          "Division".  Truncation is the same as the C operator `/'

    `%'
          "Remainder".

    `<'
    `<<'
          "Shift Left".  Same as the C operator `<<'.

    `>'
    `>>'
          "Shift Right".  Same as the C operator `>>'.

  2. Intermediate precedence

    `|'
          "Bitwise Inclusive Or".

    `&'
          "Bitwise And".

    `^'
          "Bitwise Exclusive Or".

    `!'
          "Bitwise Or Not".

  3. Lowest Precedence

    `+'
          "Addition".  If either argument is absolute, the result has
          the section of the other argument.  You may not add together
          arguments from different sections.

    `-'
          "Subtraction".  If the right argument is absolute, the result
          has the section of the left argument.  If both arguments are
          in the same section, the result is absolute.  You may not
          subtract arguments from different sections.

   In short, it's only meaningful to add or subtract the _offsets_ in an
address; you can only have a defined section in one of the two
arguments.

   All assembler directives have names that begin with a period (`.').
The rest of the name is letters, usually in lower case.

   This chapter discusses directives that are available regardless of
the target machine configuration for the GNU assembler.  Some machine
configurations provide additional directives.  *Note Machine

`.abort'
========

   This directive stops the assembly immediately.  It is for
compatibility with other assemblers.  The original idea was that the
assembly language source would be piped into the assembler.  If the
sender of the source quit, it could use this directive tells `as' to
quit also.  One day `.abort' will not be supported.


File: as.info,  Node: ABORT,  Next: Align,  Prev: Abort,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.ABORT'
========

   When producing COFF output, `as' accepts this directive as a synonym
for `.abort'.

   When producing `b.out' output, `as' accepts this directive, but
ignores it.


File: as.info,  Node: Align,  Next: Ascii,  Prev: ABORT,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.align ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
=====================================

   Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment required, as described below.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The way the required alignment is specified varies from system to
system.  For the a29k, hppa, m68k, m88k, w65, sparc, and Hitachi SH,
and i386 using ELF format, the first expression is the alignment
request in bytes.  For example `.align 8' advances the location counter
until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a
multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   For other systems, including the i386 using a.out format, and the
arm and strongarm, it is the number of low-order zero bits the location
counter must have after advancement.  For example `.align 3' advances
the location counter until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   This inconsistency is due to the different behaviors of the various
native assemblers for these systems which GAS must emulate.  GAS also
provides `.balign' and `.p2align' directives, described later, which
have a consistent behavior across all architectures (but are specific
to GAS).

`.ascii "STRING"'...
====================

   `.ascii' expects zero or more string literals (*note Strings::)
separated by commas.  It assembles each string (with no automatic
trailing zero byte) into consecutive addresses.


File: as.info,  Node: Asciz,  Next: Balign,  Prev: Ascii,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.asciz "STRING"'...
====================

   `.asciz' is just like `.ascii', but each string is followed by a
zero byte.  The "z" in `.asciz' stands for "zero".


File: as.info,  Node: Balign,  Next: Byte,  Prev: Asciz,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.balign[wl] ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
==========================================

   Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment request in bytes.  For example `.balign 8' advances the
location counter until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The `.balignw' and `.balignl' directives are variants of the
`.balign' directive.  The `.balignw' directive treats the fill pattern
as a two byte word value.  The `.balignl' directives treats the fill
pattern as a four byte longword value.  For example, `.balignw
4,0x368d' will align to a multiple of 4.  If it skips two bytes, they
will be filled in with the value 0x368d (the exact placement of the
bytes depends upon the endianness of the processor).  If it skips 1 or
3 bytes, the fill value is undefined.

`.byte EXPRESSIONS'
===================

   `.byte' expects zero or more expressions, separated by commas.  Each
expression is assembled into the next byte.


File: as.info,  Node: Comm,  Next: Data,  Prev: Byte,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.comm SYMBOL , LENGTH '
========================

   `.comm' declares a common symbol named SYMBOL.  When linking, a
common symbol in one object file may be merged with a defined or common
symbol of the same name in another object file.  If `ld' does not see a
definition for the symbol-just one or more common symbols-then it will
allocate LENGTH bytes of uninitialized memory.  LENGTH must be an
absolute expression.  If `ld' sees multiple common symbols with the
same name, and they do not all have the same size, it will allocate
space using the largest size.

   When using ELF, the `.comm' directive takes an optional third
argument.  This is the desired alignment of the symbol, specified as a
byte boundary (for example, an alignment of 16 means that the least
significant 4 bits of the address should be zero).  The alignment must
be an absolute expression, and it must be a power of two.  If `ld'
allocates uninitialized memory for the common symbol, it will use the
alignment when placing the symbol.  If no alignment is specified, `as'
will set the alignment to the largest power of two less than or equal
to the size of the symbol, up to a maximum of 16.

   The syntax for `.comm' differs slightly on the HPPA.  The syntax is
`SYMBOL .comm, LENGTH'; SYMBOL is optional.

`.data SUBSECTION'
==================

   `.data' tells `as' to assemble the following statements onto the end

expression).  If SUBSECTION is omitted, it defaults to zero.


File: as.info,  Node: Def,  Next: Desc,  Prev: Data,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.def NAME'
===========

   Begin defining debugging information for a symbol NAME; the
definition extends until the `.endef' directive is encountered.

   This directive is only observed when `as' is configured for COFF
format output; when producing `b.out', `.def' is recognized, but
ignored.


File: as.info,  Node: Desc,  Next: Dim,  Prev: Def,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.desc SYMBOL, ABS-EXPRESSION'
==============================

   This directive sets the descriptor of the symbol (*note Symbol
Attributes::) to the low 16 bits of an absolute expression.

   The `.desc' directive is not available when `as' is configured for
COFF output; it is only for `a.out' or `b.out' object format.  For the
sake of compatibility, `as' accepts it, but produces no output, when
configured for COFF.


File: as.info,  Node: Dim,  Next: Double,  Prev: Desc,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.dim'
======

   This directive is generated by compilers to include auxiliary
debugging information in the symbol table.  It is only permitted inside
`.def'/`.endef' pairs.

   `.dim' is only meaningful when generating COFF format output; when
`as' is generating `b.out', it accepts this directive but ignores it.


File: as.info,  Node: Double,  Next: Eject,  Prev: Dim,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.double FLONUMS'
=================

   `.double' expects zero or more flonums, separated by commas.  It
assembles floating point numbers.  The exact kind of floating point
numbers emitted depends on how `as' is configured.  *Note Machine
Dependencies::.


File: as.info,  Node: Eject,  Next: Else,  Prev: Double,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.eject'
========

   Force a page break at this point, when generating assembly listings.


File: as.info,  Node: Else,  Next: Elseif,  Prev: Eject,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.else'
=======

   `.else' is part of the `as' support for conditional assembly; *note
`.if': If..  It marks the beginning of a section of code to be
assembled if the condition for the preceding `.if' was false.


File: as.info,  Node: Elseif,  Next: End,  Prev: Else,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.elseif'
=========

   `.elseif' is part of the `as' support for conditional assembly;
*note `.if': If..  It is shorthand for beginning a new `.if' block that
would otherwise fill the entire `.else' section.


File: as.info,  Node: End,  Next: Endef,  Prev: Elseif,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.end'
======

   `.end' marks the end of the assembly file.  `as' does not process
anything in the file past the `.end' directive.


File: as.info,  Node: Endef,  Next: Endfunc,  Prev: End,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.endef'
========

   This directive flags the end of a symbol definition begun with
`.def'.

   `.endef' is only meaningful when generating COFF format output; if
`as' is configured to generate `b.out', it accepts this directive but
ignores it.


File: as.info,  Node: Endfunc,  Next: Endif,  Prev: Endef,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.endfunc'
==========

   `.endfunc' marks the end of a function specified with `.func'.


File: as.info,  Node: Endif,  Next: Equ,  Prev: Endfunc,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.endif'
========

   `.endif' is part of the `as' support for conditional assembly; it
marks the end of a block of code that is only assembled conditionally.
*Note `.if': If.


File: as.info,  Node: Equ,  Next: Equiv,  Prev: Endif,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.equ SYMBOL, EXPRESSION'
=========================

   This directive sets the value of SYMBOL to EXPRESSION.  It is
synonymous with `.set'; *note `.set': Set..

   The syntax for `equ' on the HPPA is `SYMBOL .equ EXPRESSION'.


File: as.info,  Node: Equiv,  Next: Err,  Prev: Equ,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.equiv SYMBOL, EXPRESSION'
===========================

   The `.equiv' directive is like `.equ' and `.set', except that the
assembler will signal an error if SYMBOL is already defined.

   Except for the contents of the error message, this is roughly
equivalent to
     .ifdef SYM
     .err
     .endif
     .equ SYM,VAL


File: as.info,  Node: Err,  Next: Exitm,  Prev: Equiv,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.err'
======

   If `as' assembles a `.err' directive, it will print an error message
and, unless the `-Z' option was used, it will not generate an object
file.  This can be used to signal error an conditionally compiled code.


File: as.info,  Node: Exitm,  Next: Extern,  Prev: Err,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.exitm'
========

   Exit early from the current macro definition.  *Note Macro::.


File: as.info,  Node: Extern,  Next: Fail,  Prev: Exitm,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.extern'
=========

   `.extern' is accepted in the source program--for compatibility with
other assemblers--but it is ignored.  `as' treats all undefined symbols
as external.


File: as.info,  Node: Fail,  Next: File,  Prev: Extern,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.fail EXPRESSION'
==================

   Generates an error or a warning.  If the value of the EXPRESSION is
500 or more, `as' will print a warning message.  If the value is less
than 500, `as' will print an error message.  The message will include
the value of EXPRESSION.  This can occasionally be useful inside
complex nested macros or conditional assembly.


File: as.info,  Node: File,  Next: Fill,  Prev: Fail,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.file STRING'
==============

   `.file' tells `as' that we are about to start a new logical file.
STRING is the new file name.  In general, the filename is recognized
whether or not it is surrounded by quotes `"'; but if you wish to
specify an empty file name, you must give the quotes-`""'.  This
statement may go away in future: it is only recognized to be compatible
with old `as' programs.  In some configurations of `as', `.file' has
already been removed to avoid conflicts with other assemblers.  *Note
Machine Dependencies::.


File: as.info,  Node: Fill,  Next: Float,  Prev: File,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.fill REPEAT , SIZE , VALUE'
=============================

   RESULT, SIZE and VALUE are absolute expressions.  This emits REPEAT
copies of SIZE bytes.  REPEAT may be zero or more.  SIZE may be zero or
more, but if it is more than 8, then it is deemed to have the value 8,
compatible with other people's assemblers.  The contents of each REPEAT
bytes is taken from an 8-byte number.  The highest order 4 bytes are
zero.  The lowest order 4 bytes are VALUE rendered in the byte-order of
an integer on the computer `as' is assembling for.  Each SIZE bytes in
a repetition is taken from the lowest order SIZE bytes of this number.
Again, this bizarre behavior is compatible with other people's
assemblers.

   SIZE and VALUE are optional.  If the second comma and VALUE are
absent, VALUE is assumed zero.  If the first comma and following tokens
are absent, SIZE is assumed to be 1.


File: as.info,  Node: Float,  Next: Func,  Prev: Fill,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.float FLONUMS'
================

   This directive assembles zero or more flonums, separated by commas.
It has the same effect as `.single'.  The exact kind of floating point
numbers emitted depends on how `as' is configured.  *Note Machine
Dependencies::.


File: as.info,  Node: Func,  Next: Global,  Prev: Float,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.func NAME[,LABEL]'
====================

   `.func' emits debugging information to denote function NAME, and is
ignored unless the file is assembled with debugging enabled.  Only
`--gstabs' is currently supported.  LABEL is the entry point of the
function and if omitted NAME prepended with the `leading char' is used.
`leading char' is usually `_' or nothing, depending on the target.  All
functions are currently defined to have `void' return type.  The
function must be terminated with `.endfunc'.


File: as.info,  Node: Global,  Next: Hidden,  Prev: Func,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.global SYMBOL', `.globl SYMBOL'
=================================

   `.global' makes the symbol visible to `ld'.  If you define SYMBOL in
your partial program, its value is made available to other partial
programs that are linked with it.  Otherwise, SYMBOL takes its
attributes from a symbol of the same name from another file linked into
the same program.

   Both spellings (`.globl' and `.global') are accepted, for
compatibility with other assemblers.

   On the HPPA, `.global' is not always enough to make it accessible to
other partial programs.  You may need the HPPA-only `.EXPORT' directive
as well.  *Note HPPA Assembler Directives: HPPA Directives.


File: as.info,  Node: Hidden,  Next: hword,  Prev: Global,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.hidden NAMES'
===============

   This one of the ELF visibility directives.  The other two are
`.internal' (*note `.internal': Internal.) and `.protected' (*note
`.protected': Protected.).

   This directive overrides the named symbols default visibility (which
is set by their binding: local, global or weak).  The directive sets
the visibility to `hidden' which means that the symbols are not visible
to other components.  Such symbols are always considered to be
`protected' as well.

File: as.info,  Node: Secs Background,  Next: Ld Sections,  Up: Sections

Background
==========

   Roughly, a section is a range of addresses, with no gaps; all data
"in" those addresses is treated the same for some particular purpose.
For example there may be a "read only" section.

   The linker `ld' reads many object files (partial programs) and
combines their contents to form a runnable program.  When `as' emits an
object file, the partial program is assumed to start at address 0.
`ld' assigns the final addresses for the partial program, so that
different partial programs do not overlap.  This is actually an
oversimplification, but it suffices to explain how `as' uses sections.

   `ld' moves blocks of bytes of your program to their run-time
addresses.  These blocks slide to their run-time addresses as rigid
units; their length does not change and neither does the order of bytes
within them.  Such a rigid unit is called a _section_.  Assigning
run-time addresses to sections is called "relocation".  It includes the
task of adjusting mentions of object-file addresses so they refer to
the proper run-time addresses.  For the H8/300 and H8/500, and for the
Hitachi SH, `as' pads sections if needed to ensure they end on a word
(sixteen bit) boundary.

   An object file written by `as' has at least three sections, any of
which may be empty.  These are named "text", "data" and "bss" sections.

   When it generates COFF output, `as' can also generate whatever other
named sections you specify using the `.section' directive (*note
`.section': Section.).  If you do not use any directives that place
output in the `.text' or `.data' sections, these sections still exist,
but are empty.

   When `as' generates SOM or ELF output for the HPPA, `as' can also
generate whatever other named sections you specify using the `.space'
and `.subspace' directives.  See `HP9000 Series 800 Assembly Language
Reference Manual' (HP 92432-90001) for details on the `.space' and
`.subspace' assembler directives.

   Additionally, `as' uses different names for the standard text, data,
and bss sections when generating SOM output.  Program text is placed
into the `$CODE$' section, data into `$DATA$', and BSS into `$BSS$'.

   Within the object file, the text section starts at address `0', the
data section follows, and the bss section follows the data section.

   When generating either SOM or ELF output files on the HPPA, the text
section starts at address `0', the data section at address `0x4000000',
and the bss section follows the data section.

   To let `ld' know which data changes when the sections are relocated,
and how to change that data, `as' also writes to the object file
details of the relocation needed.  To perform relocation `ld' must
know, each time an address in the object file is mentioned:
   * Where in the object file is the beginning of this reference to an
     address?

   * How long (in bytes) is this reference?

   * Which section does the address refer to?  What is the numeric
     value of
          (ADDRESS) - (START-ADDRESS OF SECTION)?

   * Is the reference to an address "Program-Counter relative"?

   In fact, every address `as' ever uses is expressed as
     (SECTION) + (OFFSET INTO SECTION)

Further, most expressions `as' computes have this section-relative
nature.  (For some object formats, such as SOM for the HPPA, some
expressions are symbol-relative instead.)

   In this manual we use the notation {SECNAME N} to mean "offset N
into section SECNAME."

   Apart from text, data and bss sections you need to know about the
"absolute" section.  When `ld' mixes partial programs, addresses in the
absolute section remain unchanged.  For example, address `{absolute 0}'
is "relocated" to run-time address 0 by `ld'.  Although the linker
never arranges two partial programs' data sections with overlapping
addresses after linking, _by definition_ their absolute sections must
overlap.  Address `{absolute 239}' in one part of a program is always
the same address when the program is running as address `{absolute
239}' in any other part of the program.

   The idea of sections is extended to the "undefined" section.  Any
address whose section is unknown at assembly time is by definition
rendered {undefined U}--where U is filled in later.  Since numbers are
always defined, the only way to generate an undefined address is to
mention an undefined symbol.  A reference to a named common block would
be such a symbol: its value is unknown at assembly time so it has
section _undefined_.

   By analogy the word _section_ is used to describe groups of sections
in the linked program.  `ld' puts all partial programs' text sections
in contiguous addresses in the linked program.  It is customary to
refer to the _text section_ of a program, meaning all the addresses of
all partial programs' text sections.  Likewise for data and bss
sections.

   Some sections are manipulated by `ld'; others are invented for use
of `as' and have no meaning except during assembly.


File: as.info,  Node: Ld Sections,  Next: As Sections,  Prev: Secs Background,  Up: Sections

Linker Sections
===============

   `ld' deals with just four kinds of sections, summarized below.

*named sections*
*text section*
*data section*
     These sections hold your program.  `as' and `ld' treat them as
     separate but equal sections.  Anything you can say of one section
     is true another.  When the program is running, however, it is
     customary for the text section to be unalterable.  The text
     section is often shared among processes: it contains instructions,
     constants and the like.  The data section of a running program is
     usually alterable: for example, C variables would be stored in the
     data section.

*bss section*
     This section contains zeroed bytes when your program begins
     running.  It is used to hold unitialized variables or common
     storage.  The length of each partial program's bss section is
     important, but because it starts out containing zeroed bytes there
     is no need to store explicit zero bytes in the object file.  The
     bss section was invented to eliminate those explicit zeros from
     object files.

*absolute section*
     Address 0 of this section is always "relocated" to runtime address
     0.  This is useful if you want to refer to an address that `ld'
     must not change when relocating.  In this sense we speak of
     absolute addresses being "unrelocatable": they do not change
     during relocation.

*undefined section*
     This "section" is a catch-all for address references to objects
     not in the preceding sections.

   An idealized example of three relocatable sections follows.  The
example uses the traditional section names `.text' and `.data'.  Memory
addresses are on the horizontal axis.

                           +-----+----+--+

         addresses:        0 ...


File: as.info,  Node: As Sections,  Next: Sub-Sections,  Prev: Ld Sections,  Up: Sections

Assembler Internal Sections
===========================

   These sections are meant only for the internal use of `as'.  They
have no meaning at run-time.  You do not really need to know about these
sections for most purposes; but they can be mentioned in `as' warning
messages, so it might be helpful to have an idea of their meanings to
`as'.  These sections are used to permit the value of every expression
in your assembly language program to be a section-relative address.

ASSEMBLER-INTERNAL-LOGIC-ERROR!
     An internal assembler logic error has been found.  This means
     there is a bug in the assembler.

expr section
     The assembler stores complex expression internally as combinations
     of symbols.  When it needs to represent an expression as a symbol,
     it puts it in the expr section.


File: as.info,  Node: Sub-Sections,  Next: bss,  Prev: As Sections,  Up: Sections

Sub-Sections
============

   Assembled bytes conventionally fall into two sections: text and data.
You may have separate groups of data in named sections that you want to
end up near to each other in the object file, even though they are not
contiguous in the assembler source.  `as' allows you to use
"subsections" for this purpose.  Within each section, there can be
numbered subsections with values from 0 to 8192.  Objects assembled
into the same subsection go into the object file together with other
objects in the same subsection.  For example, a compiler might want to
store constants in the text section, but might not want to have them
interspersed with the program being assembled.  In this case, the
compiler could issue a `.text 0' before each section of code being
output, and a `.text 1' before each group of constants being output.

   Subsections are optional.  If you do not use subsections, everything
goes in subsection number zero.

   Each subsection is zero-padded up to a multiple of four bytes.
(Subsections may be padded a different amount on different flavors of
`as'.)

   Subsections appear in your object file in numeric order, lowest
numbered to highest.  (All this to be compatible with other people's
assemblers.)  The object file contains no representation of
subsections; `ld' and other programs that manipulate object files see
no trace of them.  They just see all your text subsections as a text
section, and all your data subsections as a data section.

   To specify which subsection you want subsequent statements assembled
into, use a numeric argument to specify it, in a `.text EXPRESSION' or
a `.data EXPRESSION' statement.  When generating COFF output, you can
also use an extra subsection argument with arbitrary named sections:
`.section NAME, EXPRESSION'.  EXPRESSION should be an absolute
expression.  (*Note Expressions::.)  If you just say `.text' then
`.text 0' is assumed.  Likewise `.data' means `.data 0'.  Assembly
begins in `text 0'.  For instance:
     .text 0     # The default subsection is text 0 anyway.
     .ascii "This lives in the first text subsection. *"
     .text 1
     .ascii "But this lives in the second text subsection."
     .data 0
     .ascii "This lives in the data section,"
     .ascii "in the first data subsection."
     .text 0
     .ascii "This lives in the first text section,"
     .ascii "immediately following the asterisk (*)."

   Each section has a "location counter" incremented by one for every
byte assembled into that section.  Because subsections are merely a
convenience restricted to `as' there is no concept of a subsection
location counter.  There is no way to directly manipulate a location
counter--but the `.align' directive changes it, and any label
definition captures its current value.  The location counter of the
section where statements are being assembled is said to be the "active"
location counter.


File: as.info,  Node: bss,  Prev: Sub-Sections,  Up: Sections

bss Section
===========

   The bss section is used for local common variable storage.  You may
allocate address space in the bss section, but you may not dictate data
to load into it before your program executes.  When your program starts
running, all the contents of the bss section are zeroed bytes.

   The `.lcomm' pseudo-op defines a symbol in the bss section; see
*Note `.lcomm': Lcomm.

   The `.comm' pseudo-op may be used to declare a common symbol, which
is another form of uninitialized symbol; see *Note `.comm': Comm.

   When assembling for a target which supports multiple sections, such
as ELF or COFF, you may switch into the `.bss' section and define
symbols as usual; see *Note `.section': Section.  You may only assemble
zero values into the section.  Typically the section will only contain
symbol definitions and `.skip' directives (*note `.skip': Skip.).


File: as.info,  Node: Symbols,  Next: Expressions,  Prev: Sections,  Up: Top

Symbols
*******

   Symbols are a central concept: the programmer uses symbols to name
things, the linker uses symbols to link, and the debugger uses symbols
to debug.

     _Warning:_ `as' does not place symbols in the object file in the
     same order they were declared.  This may break some debuggers.

* Symbol Attributes::           Symbol Attributes


File: as.info,  Node: Labels,  Next: Setting Symbols,  Up: Symbols

Labels
======

   A "label" is written as a symbol immediately followed by a colon
`:'.  The symbol then represents the current value of the active
location counter, and is, for example, a suitable instruction operand.
You are warned if you use the same symbol to represent two different
locations: the first definition overrides any other definitions.

   On the HPPA, the usual form for a label need not be immediately
followed by a colon, but instead must start in column zero.  Only one
label may be defined on a single line.  To work around this, the HPPA
version of `as' also provides a special directive `.label' for defining
labels more flexibly.


File: as.info,  Node: Setting Symbols,  Next: Symbol Names,  Prev: Labels,  Up: Symbols

Giving Symbols Other Values
===========================

   A symbol can be given an arbitrary value by writing a symbol,
followed by an equals sign `=', followed by an expression (*note
Expressions::).  This is equivalent to using the `.set' directive.
*Note `.set': Set.


File: as.info,  Node: Symbol Names,  Next: Dot,  Prev: Setting Symbols,  Up: Symbols

Symbol Names
============

   Symbol names begin with a letter or with one of `._'.  On most
machines, you can also use `$' in symbol names; exceptions are noted in
*Note Machine Dependencies::.  That character may be followed by any
string of digits, letters, dollar signs (unless otherwise noted in
*Note Machine Dependencies::), and underscores.  For the AMD 29K
family, `?' is also allowed in the body of a symbol name, though not at
its beginning.

   Case of letters is significant: `foo' is a different symbol name
than `Foo'.

   Each symbol has exactly one name.  Each name in an assembly language
program refers to exactly one symbol.  You may use that symbol name any
number of times in a program.

Local Symbol Names
------------------

   Local symbols help compilers and programmers use names temporarily.
There are ten local symbol names, which are re-used throughout the
program.  You may refer to them using the names `0' `1' ... `9'.  To
define a local symbol, write a label of the form `N:' (where N
represents any digit).  To refer to the most recent previous definition
of that symbol write `Nb', using the same digit as when you defined the
label.  To refer to the next definition of a local label, write
`Nf'--where N gives you a choice of 10 forward references.  The `b'
stands for "backwards" and the `f' stands for "forwards".

   Local symbols are not emitted by the current GNU C compiler.

   There is no restriction on how you can use these labels, but
remember that at any point in the assembly you can refer to at most 10
prior local labels and to at most 10 forward local labels.

   Local symbol names are only a notation device.  They are immediately
transformed into more conventional symbol names before the assembler
uses them.  The symbol names stored in the symbol table, appearing in
error messages and optionally emitted to the object file have these
parts:

`L'
     All local labels begin with `L'. Normally both `as' and `ld'
     forget symbols that start with `L'. These labels are used for
     symbols you are never intended to see.  If you use the `-L' option
     then `as' retains these symbols in the object file. If you also
     instruct `ld' to retain these symbols, you may use them in
     debugging.

`DIGIT'
     If the label is written `0:' then the digit is `0'.  If the label
     is written `1:' then the digit is `1'.  And so on up through `9:'.

`C-A'
     This unusual character is included so you do not accidentally
     invent a symbol of the same name.  The character has ASCII value
     `\001'.

`_ordinal number_'
     This is a serial number to keep the labels distinct.  The first
     `0:' gets the number `1'; The 15th `0:' gets the number `15';
     _etc._.  Likewise for the other labels `1:' through `9:'.

   For instance, the first `1:' is named `L1C-A1', the 44th `3:' is
named `L3C-A44'.

The Special Dot Symbol
======================

   The special symbol `.' refers to the current address that `as' is
assembling into.  Thus, the expression `melvin: .long .' defines
`melvin' to contain its own address.  Assigning a value to `.' is
treated the same as a `.org' directive.  Thus, the expression `.=.+4'
is the same as saying `.space 4'.


File: as.info,  Node: Symbol Attributes,  Prev: Dot,  Up: Symbols

Symbol Attributes
=================

   Every symbol has, as well as its name, the attributes "Value" and
"Type".  Depending on output format, symbols can also have auxiliary
attributes.

   If you use a symbol without defining it, `as' assumes zero for all
these attributes, and probably won't warn you.  This makes the symbol
an externally defined symbol, which is generally what you would want.

Value
-----

   The value of a symbol is (usually) 32 bits.  For a symbol which
labels a location in the text, data, bss or absolute sections the value
is the number of addresses from the start of that section to the label.
Naturally for text, data and bss sections the value of a symbol changes
as `ld' changes section base addresses during linking.  Absolute
symbols' values do not change during linking: that is why they are
called absolute.

   The value of an undefined symbol is treated in a special way.  If it
is 0 then the symbol is not defined in this assembler source file, and
`ld' tries to determine its value from other files linked into the same
program.  You make this kind of symbol simply by mentioning a symbol
name without defining it.  A non-zero value represents a `.comm' common
declaration.  The value is how much common storage to reserve, in bytes
(addresses).  The symbol refers to the first address of the allocated
storage.

Type
----

   The type attribute of a symbol contains relocation (section)
information, any flag settings indicating that a symbol is external, and
(optionally), other information for linkers and debuggers.  The exact
format depends on the object-code output format in use.

   The symbol name is set with `.def'; the value and type,
respectively, with `.val' and `.type'.

Expressions
***********

   An "expression" specifies an address or numeric value.  Whitespace
may precede and/or follow an expression.

   The result of an expression must be an absolute number, or else an
offset into a particular section.  If an expression is not absolute,
and there is not enough information when `as' sees the expression to
know its section, a second pass over the source program might be
necessary to interpret the expression--but the second pass is currently
not implemented.  `as' aborts with an error message in this situation.

* Menu:

* Empty Exprs::                 Empty Expressions
* Integer Exprs::               Integer Expressions


File: as.info,  Node: Empty Exprs,  Next: Integer Exprs,  Up: Expressions

Empty Expressions
=================

   An empty expression has no value: it is just whitespace or null.
Wherever an absolute expression is required, you may omit the
expression, and `as' assumes a value of (absolute) 0.  This is
compatible with other assemblers.


File: as.info,  Node: Integer Exprs,  Prev: Empty Exprs,  Up: Expressions

Integer Expressions
===================

   An "integer expression" is one or more _arguments_ delimited by
_operators_.

* Arguments::                   Arguments
* Operators::                   Operators

File: as.info,  Node: Arguments,  Next: Operators,  Up: Integer Exprs

Arguments
---------

   "Arguments" are symbols, numbers or subexpressions.  In other
contexts arguments are sometimes called "arithmetic operands".  In this
manual, to avoid confusing them with the "instruction operands" of the
machine language, we use the term "argument" to refer to parts of
expressions only, reserving the word "operand" to refer only to machine
instruction operands.

   Symbols are evaluated to yield {SECTION NNN} where SECTION is one of
text, data, bss, absolute, or undefined.  NNN is a signed, 2's
complement 32 bit integer.

   Numbers are usually integers.

   A number can be a flonum or bignum.  In this case, you are warned
that only the low order 32 bits are used, and `as' pretends these 32
bits are an integer.  You may write integer-manipulating instructions
that act on exotic constants, compatible with other assemblers.

   Subexpressions are a left parenthesis `(' followed by an integer
expression, followed by a right parenthesis `)'; or a prefix operator
followed by an argument.


File: as.info,  Node: Operators,  Next: Prefix Ops,  Prev: Arguments,  Up: Integer Exprs

Operators
---------

   "Operators" are arithmetic functions, like `+' or `%'.  Prefix
operators are followed by an argument.  Infix operators appear between
their arguments.  Operators may be preceded and/or followed by
whitespace.


File: as.info,  Node: Prefix Ops,  Next: Infix Ops,  Prev: Operators,  Up: Integer Exprs

Prefix Operator
---------------

   `as' has the following "prefix operators".  They each take one
argument, which must be absolute.

`-'
     "Negation".  Two's complement negation.

`~'
     "Complementation".  Bitwise not.


File: as.info,  Node: Infix Ops,  Prev: Prefix Ops,  Up: Integer Exprs

Infix Operators
---------------

   "Infix operators" take two arguments, one on either side.  Operators
have precedence, but operations with equal precedence are performed left
to right.  Apart from `+' or `-', both arguments must be absolute, and
the result is absolute.

  1. Highest Precedence

    `*'
          "Multiplication".

    `/'
          "Division".  Truncation is the same as the C operator `/'

    `%'
          "Remainder".

    `<'
    `<<'
          "Shift Left".  Same as the C operator `<<'.

    `>'
    `>>'
          "Shift Right".  Same as the C operator `>>'.

  2. Intermediate precedence

    `|'
          "Bitwise Inclusive Or".

    `&'
          "Bitwise And".

    `^'
          "Bitwise Exclusive Or".

    `!'
          "Bitwise Or Not".

  3. Lowest Precedence

    `+'
          "Addition".  If either argument is absolute, the result has
          the section of the other argument.  You may not add together
          arguments from different sections.

    `-'
          "Subtraction".  If the right argument is absolute, the result
          has the section of the left argument.  If both arguments are
          in the same section, the result is absolute.  You may not
          subtract arguments from different sections.

   In short, it's only meaningful to add or subtract the _offsets_ in an
address; you can only have a defined section in one of the two
arguments.

Assembler Directives
********************

   All assembler directives have names that begin with a period (`.').
The rest of the name is letters, usually in lower case.

the target machine configuration for the GNU assembler.  Some machine
configurations provide additional directives.  *Note Machine

`.abort'
========

   This directive stops the assembly immediately.  It is for
compatibility with other assemblers.  The original idea was that the
assembly language source would be piped into the assembler.  If the
sender of the source quit, it could use this directive tells `as' to
quit also.  One day `.abort' will not be supported.


File: as.info,  Node: ABORT,  Next: Align,  Prev: Abort,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.ABORT'
========

   When producing COFF output, `as' accepts this directive as a synonym
for `.abort'.

   When producing `b.out' output, `as' accepts this directive, but
ignores it.


File: as.info,  Node: Align,  Next: Ascii,  Prev: ABORT,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.align ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
=====================================

   Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment required, as described below.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The way the required alignment is specified varies from system to
system.  For the a29k, hppa, m68k, m88k, w65, sparc, and Hitachi SH,
and i386 using ELF format, the first expression is the alignment
request in bytes.  For example `.align 8' advances the location counter
until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a
multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   For other systems, including the i386 using a.out format, it is the
number of low-order zero bits the location counter must have after
advancement.  For example `.align 3' advances the location counter
until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter is already a
multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   This inconsistency is due to the different behaviors of the various
native assemblers for these systems which GAS must emulate.  GAS also
provides `.balign' and `.p2align' directives, described later, which
have a consistent behavior across all architectures (but are specific
to GAS).

`.ascii "STRING"'...
====================

separated by commas.  It assembles each string (with no automatic
trailing zero byte) into consecutive addresses.


File: as.info,  Node: Asciz,  Next: Balign,  Prev: Ascii,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.asciz "STRING"'...
====================

   `.asciz' is just like `.ascii', but each string is followed by a
zero byte.  The "z" in `.asciz' stands for "zero".


File: as.info,  Node: Balign,  Next: Byte,  Prev: Asciz,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.balign[wl] ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR, ABS-EXPR'
==========================================

   Pad the location counter (in the current subsection) to a particular
storage boundary.  The first expression (which must be absolute) is the
alignment request in bytes.  For example `.balign 8' advances the
location counter until it is a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.

   The second expression (also absolute) gives the fill value to be
stored in the padding bytes.  It (and the comma) may be omitted.  If it
is omitted, the padding bytes are normally zero.  However, on some
systems, if the section is marked as containing code and the fill value
is omitted, the space is filled with no-op instructions.

   The third expression is also absolute, and is also optional.  If it
is present, it is the maximum number of bytes that should be skipped by
this alignment directive.  If doing the alignment would require
skipping more bytes than the specified maximum, then the alignment is
not done at all.  You can omit the fill value (the second argument)
entirely by simply using two commas after the required alignment; this
can be useful if you want the alignment to be filled with no-op
instructions when appropriate.

   The `.balignw' and `.balignl' directives are variants of the
`.balign' directive.  The `.balignw' directive treats the fill pattern
as a two byte word value.  The `.balignl' directives treats the fill
pattern as a four byte longword value.  For example, `.balignw
4,0x368d' will align to a multiple of 4.  If it skips two bytes, they
will be filled in with the value 0x368d (the exact placement of the
bytes depends upon the endianness of the processor).  If it skips 1 or
3 bytes, the fill value is undefined.


File: as.info,  Node: Byte,  Next: Comm,  Prev: Balign,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.byte EXPRESSIONS'
===================

   `.byte' expects zero or more expressions, separated by commas.  Each
expression is assembled into the next byte.


File: as.info,  Node: Comm,  Next: Data,  Prev: Byte,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.comm SYMBOL , LENGTH '
========================

   `.comm' declares a common symbol named SYMBOL.  When linking, a
common symbol in one object file may be merged with a defined or common
symbol of the same name in another object file.  If `ld' does not see a
definition for the symbol-just one or more common symbols-then it will
allocate LENGTH bytes of uninitialized memory.  LENGTH must be an
absolute expression.  If `ld' sees multiple common symbols with the
same name, and they do not all have the same size, it will allocate
space using the largest size.

   When using ELF, the `.comm' directive takes an optional third
argument.  This is the desired alignment of the symbol, specified as a
byte boundary (for example, an alignment of 16 means that the least
significant 4 bits of the address should be zero).  The alignment must
be an absolute expression, and it must be a power of two.  If `ld'
allocates uninitialized memory for the common symbol, it will use the
alignment when placing the symbol.  If no alignment is specified, `as'
will set the alignment to the largest power of two less than or equal
to the size of the symbol, up to a maximum of 16.

   The syntax for `.comm' differs slightly on the HPPA.  The syntax is
`SYMBOL .comm, LENGTH'; SYMBOL is optional.

`.data SUBSECTION'
==================

   `.data' tells `as' to assemble the following statements onto the end
of the data subsection numbered SUBSECTION (which is an absolute
expression).  If SUBSECTION is omitted, it defaults to zero.


File: as.info,  Node: Def,  Next: Desc,  Prev: Data,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.def NAME'
===========

   Begin defining debugging information for a symbol NAME; the
definition extends until the `.endef' directive is encountered.

   This directive is only observed when `as' is configured for COFF
format output; when producing `b.out', `.def' is recognized, but
ignored.


File: as.info,  Node: Desc,  Next: Dim,  Prev: Def,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.desc SYMBOL, ABS-EXPRESSION'
==============================

   This directive sets the descriptor of the symbol (*note Symbol
Attributes::) to the low 16 bits of an absolute expression.

   The `.desc' directive is not available when `as' is configured for
COFF output; it is only for `a.out' or `b.out' object format.  For the
sake of compatibility, `as' accepts it, but produces no output, when
configured for COFF.


File: as.info,  Node: Dim,  Next: Double,  Prev: Desc,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.dim'
======

   This directive is generated by compilers to include auxiliary
debugging information in the symbol table.  It is only permitted inside
`.def'/`.endef' pairs.

   `.dim' is only meaningful when generating COFF format output; when
`as' is generating `b.out', it accepts this directive but ignores it.


File: as.info,  Node: Double,  Next: Eject,  Prev: Dim,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.double FLONUMS'
=================

assembles floating point numbers.  The exact kind of floating point
numbers emitted depends on how `as' is configured.  *Note Machine
Dependencies::.


File: as.info,  Node: Eject,  Next: Else,  Prev: Double,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.eject'
========

   Force a page break at this point, when generating assembly listings.


File: as.info,  Node: Else,  Next: Elseif,  Prev: Eject,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.else'
=======

   `.else' is part of the `as' support for conditional assembly; *note
`.if': If..  It marks the beginning of a section of code to be
assembled if the condition for the preceding `.if' was false.


File: as.info,  Node: Elseif,  Next: End,  Prev: Else,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.elseif'
=========

   `.elseif' is part of the `as' support for conditional assembly;
*note `.if': If..  It is shorthand for beginning a new `.if' block that
would otherwise fill the entire `.else' section.


File: as.info,  Node: End,  Next: Endef,  Prev: Elseif,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.end'
======

   `.end' marks the end of the assembly file.  `as' does not process
anything in the file past the `.end' directive.


File: as.info,  Node: Endef,  Next: Endfunc,  Prev: End,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.endef'
========

   This directive flags the end of a symbol definition begun with
`.def'.

   `.endef' is only meaningful when generating COFF format output; if
`as' is configured to generate `b.out', it accepts this directive but
ignores it.


File: as.info,  Node: Endfunc,  Next: Endif,  Prev: Endef,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.endfunc'
==========

   `.endfunc' marks the end of a function specified with `.func'.


File: as.info,  Node: Endif,  Next: Equ,  Prev: Endfunc,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.endif'
========

   `.endif' is part of the `as' support for conditional assembly; it
marks the end of a block of code that is only assembled conditionally.
*Note `.if': If.


File: as.info,  Node: Equ,  Next: Equiv,  Prev: Endif,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.equ SYMBOL, EXPRESSION'
=========================

   This directive sets the value of SYMBOL to EXPRESSION.  It is
synonymous with `.set'; *note `.set': Set..

   The syntax for `equ' on the HPPA is `SYMBOL .equ EXPRESSION'.


File: as.info,  Node: Equiv,  Next: Err,  Prev: Equ,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.equiv SYMBOL, EXPRESSION'
===========================

   The `.equiv' directive is like `.equ' and `.set', except that the
assembler will signal an error if SYMBOL is already defined.

   Except for the contents of the error message, this is roughly
equivalent to
     .ifdef SYM
     .err
     .endif
     .equ SYM,VAL


File: as.info,  Node: Err,  Next: Exitm,  Prev: Equiv,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.err'
======

   If `as' assembles a `.err' directive, it will print an error message
and, unless the `-Z' option was used, it will not generate an object
file.  This can be used to signal error an conditionally compiled code.


File: as.info,  Node: Exitm,  Next: Extern,  Prev: Err,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.exitm'
========

   Exit early from the current macro definition.  *Note Macro::.


File: as.info,  Node: Extern,  Next: Fail,  Prev: Exitm,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.extern'
=========

   `.extern' is accepted in the source program--for compatibility with
other assemblers--but it is ignored.  `as' treats all undefined symbols
as external.


File: as.info,  Node: Fail,  Next: File,  Prev: Extern,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.fail EXPRESSION'
==================

   Generates an error or a warning.  If the value of the EXPRESSION is
500 or more, `as' will print a warning message.  If the value is less
than 500, `as' will print an error message.  The message will include
the value of EXPRESSION.  This can occasionally be useful inside
complex nested macros or conditional assembly.


File: as.info,  Node: File,  Next: Fill,  Prev: Fail,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.file STRING'
==============

   `.file' tells `as' that we are about to start a new logical file.
STRING is the new file name.  In general, the filename is recognized
whether or not it is surrounded by quotes `"'; but if you wish to
specify an empty file name, you must give the quotes-`""'.  This
statement may go away in future: it is only recognized to be compatible
with old `as' programs.  In some configurations of `as', `.file' has
already been removed to avoid conflicts with other assemblers.  *Note
Machine Dependencies::.


File: as.info,  Node: Fill,  Next: Float,  Prev: File,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.fill REPEAT , SIZE , VALUE'
=============================

   RESULT, SIZE and VALUE are absolute expressions.  This emits REPEAT
copies of SIZE bytes.  REPEAT may be zero or more.  SIZE may be zero or
more, but if it is more than 8, then it is deemed to have the value 8,
compatible with other people's assemblers.  The contents of each REPEAT
bytes is taken from an 8-byte number.  The highest order 4 bytes are
zero.  The lowest order 4 bytes are VALUE rendered in the byte-order of
an integer on the computer `as' is assembling for.  Each SIZE bytes in
a repetition is taken from the lowest order SIZE bytes of this number.
Again, this bizarre behavior is compatible with other people's
assemblers.

   SIZE and VALUE are optional.  If the second comma and VALUE are
absent, VALUE is assumed zero.  If the first comma and following tokens
are absent, SIZE is assumed to be 1.


File: as.info,  Node: Float,  Next: Func,  Prev: Fill,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.float FLONUMS'
================

   This directive assembles zero or more flonums, separated by commas.
It has the same effect as `.single'.  The exact kind of floating point
numbers emitted depends on how `as' is configured.  *Note Machine
Dependencies::.


File: as.info,  Node: Func,  Next: Global,  Prev: Float,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.func NAME[,LABEL]'
====================

   `.func' emits debugging information to denote function NAME, and is
ignored unless the file is assembled with debugging enabled.  Only
`--gstabs' is currently supported.  LABEL is the entry point of the
function and if omitted NAME prepended with the `leading char' is used.
`leading char' is usually `_' or nothing, depending on the target.  All
functions are currently defined to have `void' return type.  The
function must be terminated with `.endfunc'.


File: as.info,  Node: Global,  Next: hword,  Prev: Func,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.global SYMBOL', `.globl SYMBOL'
=================================

   `.global' makes the symbol visible to `ld'.  If you define SYMBOL in
your partial program, its value is made available to other partial
programs that are linked with it.  Otherwise, SYMBOL takes its
attributes from a symbol of the same name from another file linked into
the same program.

   Both spellings (`.globl' and `.global') are accepted, for
compatibility with other assemblers.

   On the HPPA, `.global' is not always enough to make it accessible to
other partial programs.  You may need the HPPA-only `.EXPORT' directive
as well.  *Note HPPA Assembler Directives: HPPA Directives.


File: as.info,  Node: hword,  Next: Ident,  Prev: Global,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.hword EXPRESSIONS'
====================

   This expects zero or more EXPRESSIONS, and emits a 16 bit number for
each.

   This directive is a synonym for `.short'; depending on the target
architecture, it may also be a synonym for `.word'.


File: as.info,  Node: Ident,  Next: If,  Prev: hword,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.ident'
========

   This directive is used by some assemblers to place tags in object
files.  `as' simply accepts the directive for source-file compatibility
with such assemblers, but does not actually emit anything for it.


File: as.info,  Node: If,  Next: Include,  Prev: Ident,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.if ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
=========================

   `.if' marks the beginning of a section of code which is only
considered part of the source program being assembled if the argument
(which must be an ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION) is non-zero.  The end of the
conditional section of code must be marked by `.endif' (*note `.endif':
Endif.); optionally, you may include code for the alternative
condition, flagged by `.else' (*note `.else': Else.).  If you have
several conditions to check, `.elseif' may be used to avoid nesting
blocks if/else within each subsequent `.else' block.

   The following variants of `.if' are also supported:
`.ifdef SYMBOL'
     Assembles the following section of code if the specified SYMBOL
     has been defined.

`.ifc STRING1,STRING2'
     Assembles the following section of code if the two strings are the
     same.  The strings may be optionally quoted with single quotes.
     If they are not quoted, the first string stops at the first comma,
     and the second string stops at the end of the line.  Strings which
     contain whitespace should be quoted.  The string comparison is
     case sensitive.

`.ifeq ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is zero.

`.ifeqs STRING1,STRING2'
     Another form of `.ifc'.  The strings must be quoted using double
     quotes.

`.ifge ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is greater
     than or equal to zero.

`.ifgt ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is greater
     than zero.

`.ifle ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is less
     than or equal to zero.

`.iflt ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is less
     than zero.

`.ifnc STRING1,STRING2.'
     Like `.ifc', but the sense of the test is reversed: this assembles
     the following section of code if the two strings are not the same.

`.ifndef SYMBOL'
`.ifnotdef SYMBOL'
     Assembles the following section of code if the specified SYMBOL
     has not been defined.  Both spelling variants are equivalent.

`.ifne ABSOLUTE EXPRESSION'
     Assembles the following section of code if the argument is not
     equal to zero (in other words, this is equivalent to `.if').

`.ifnes STRING1,STRING2'
     Like `.ifeqs', but the sense of the test is reversed: this
     assembles the following section of code if the two strings are not
     the same.


File: as.info,  Node: Include,  Next: Int,  Prev: If,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.include "FILE"'
=================

   This directive provides a way to include supporting files at
specified points in your source program.  The code from FILE is
assembled as if it followed the point of the `.include'; when the end
of the included file is reached, assembly of the original file
continues.  You can control the search paths used with the `-I'
command-line option (*note Command-Line Options: Invoking.).  Quotation
marks are required around FILE.


File: as.info,  Node: Int,  Next: Irp,  Prev: Include,  Up: Pseudo Ops

`.int EXPRESSIONS'
==================

   Expect zero or more EXPRESSIONS, of any section, separated by commas.
For each expression, emit a number that, at run time, is the value of
that expression.  The byte order and bit size of the number depends on
what kind of target the assembly is for.

   For other systems, including the i386 using a.out format, and the
arm and strongarm, it is the number of low-order zero bits the location
counter must have after advancement.  For example `.align 3' advances
the location counter until it a multiple of 8.  If the location counter
is already a multiple of 8, no change is needed.
