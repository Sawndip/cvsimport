The Xilinx MicroBlaze processor family includes several variants, all using
the same core instruction set.  This chapter covers features of the @@sc{gnu}
assembler that are specific to the MicroBlaze architecture.  For details about
the MicroBlaze instruction set, please see the @@cite{MicroBlaze Processor
Reference Guide (UG081)} available at www.xilinx.com.

@@cindex MicroBlaze directives
A number of assembler directives are available for MicroBlaze.

This directive is an alias for @@code{.byte}. Each expression is assembled
into an eight-bit value.

This directive is an alias for @@code{.hword}. Each expression is assembled
into an 16-bit value.

@@item .data32 @@var{expression},...
This directive is an alias for @@code{.word}. Each expression is assembled
into an 32-bit value.

@@item .ent @@var{name}[,@@var{label}]
This directive is an alias for @@code{.func} denoting the start of function
@@var{name} at (optional) @@var{label}.

@@item .end @@var{name}[,@@var{label}]
This directive is an alias for @@code{.endfunc} denoting the end of function
@@var{name}.

@@item .gpword @@var{label},...
This directive is an alias for @@code{.rva}.  The resolved address of @@var{label}
is stored in the data section.

@@item .weakext @@var{label}
Declare that @@var{label} is a weak external symbol.

@@subsection Special Characters

@@cindex line comment character, MicroBlaze
@@cindex MicroBlaze line comment character
The presence of a @@samp{#} on a line indicates the start of a comment
that extends to the end of the current line.

If a @@samp{#} appears as the first character of a line, the whole line
is treated as a comment, but in this case the line can also be a
logical line number directive (@@pxref{Comments}) or a
preprocessor control command (@@pxref{Preprocessing}).

@@cindex line separator, MicroBlaze
@@cindex statement separator, MicroBlaze
@@cindex MicroBlaze line separator
The @@samp{;} character can be used to separate statements on the same
line.
