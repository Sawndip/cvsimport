@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.

@sim: bfin: move model data into machs.h

Pull the model data (register addresses/sizes) out of the different model
files and into the machs.h header.  The models themselves don't care about
where they're mapped, only the mach code does.  This allows us to keep the
model headers from being included in the mach code which can cause issues
with model-specific names colliding.  Such as when a newer device model is
created, but with incompatible register names/layouts.

@sim: bfin: implement loop back support in the UARTs

The UART has a LOOP_ENA bit in its MCR register where writes to the THR
go to the RBR.  Implement support for this mode.

@sim: bfin: define more UART LSR bits

We'll need these bits in an upcoming patch, so map out the whole
LSR MMR now.

Fix up indentation style while we're here.

@sim: bfin: new port

This can boot Das U-Boot and a Linux kernel.  It also supports Linux
userspace FLAT and FDPIC (dynamic and static) ELFs.
