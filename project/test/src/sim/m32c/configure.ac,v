@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.

@sim: rename common/aclocal.m4 to common/acinclude.m4

Automake likes to dump macros automatically used into the aclocal.m4
file, but the common/aclocal.m4 naming prevents that.  So rename it
to the more normal "acinclude.m4" so the aclocal tool can work.

@sim: move from common.m4 to SIM_AC_COMMON

Now that the sourceware tree generally requires autoconf-2.64, update
the sim tree to require that too.

This allows us to drop the long standing SIM_AC_COMMON/common.m4
workaround as autoconf 2.64+ seems to work for me.

@sim: m32c/rx: rename configure.in to match rest of the tree

The sim dir has 30 configure.ac files and 2 configure.in files.
So rename the minority to be consistent.
