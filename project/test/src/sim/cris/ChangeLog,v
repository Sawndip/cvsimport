@sim: use AM_MAINTAINER_MODE

I noticed the sim code is using an old implementation of the maintainer logic.
I cut it over to the new macro (like gdb has been doing).  In practice, it
makes no difference currently as nothing in the sim tree uses it, but I have a
follow up commit for the Blackfin tree that needs it.

@sim: rewrite SIM_AC_OPTION_HARDWARE a bit to simplify things

There's no need to put the majority of the logic into the 3rd arg of the
AC_ARG_ENABLE.  Coupled with the lack of indentation, it makes it hard to
follow, error prone to update, and duplicates code (with the 4th arg).

So pull the logic out of the 3rd arg and outside of the AC_ARG_ENABLE
macro.  This allows us to gut the 4th arg entirely, merge with the code
that followed the macro, and fix bugs related to the new dv-sockser in
the process.

Hopefully building the various sims with the default sim-hardware
settings, as well as with explicit --{dis,en}able-sim-hardware flags,
should all just work now.

@Define PACKAGE macro in all sims' config.h.

Some of the common includes in include/gdb such as callback.h
include bfd.h.  But there was a recent change in bfd-in.h to
require that config.h be included before bfd.h can be included:

    /* PR 14072: Ensure that config.h is included first.  */
    #if !defined PACKAGE && !defined PACKAGE_VERSION
    #error config.h must be included before this header
    #endif

PACKAGE_VERSION is always defined by default by the AC_INIT autoconf
macro, but PACKAGE isn't.  This patch updates the SIM_AC_COMMON macro
to define it, and then regenerates all configure scripts and config.in
files.

@[PATCH] sim: make sure to include strsignal prototype

Before POSIX standardized strsignal(), old systems would hide the
prototype unless the normal extension defines were enabled.  So use
the AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS helper for that.

Then make sure we include string.h ourselves in nrun.c rather than
relying on implicit includes via other sim headers.

@sim: rename common/aclocal.m4 to common/acinclude.m4

Automake likes to dump macros automatically used into the aclocal.m4
file, but the common/aclocal.m4 naming prevents that.  So rename it
to the more normal "acinclude.m4" so the aclocal tool can work.

@sim: move from common.m4 to SIM_AC_COMMON

Now that the sourceware tree generally requires autoconf-2.64, update
the sim tree to require that too.

This allows us to drop the long standing SIM_AC_COMMON/common.m4
workaround as autoconf 2.64+ seems to work for me.

@sim: start a unified sim_do_command

Since sim_do_command for many people simply calls sim_args_command, start
a unified version of it.  For people who handle their own options, they
could switch to this by using sim_add_option_table instead.
