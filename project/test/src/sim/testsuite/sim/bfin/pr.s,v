@sim: bfin: import testsuite

Now that the common sim testsuite code supports .S and .c files, we
can import the Blackfin testsuite.  There are about ~800 tests here,
so I'm only attaching a compressed patch of them.  Other than adding
files to sim/testsuite/sim/bfin/, the sim/configure.tgt file was
updated to mark Blackfin as having a testsuite, and sim/configure
regenerated.
