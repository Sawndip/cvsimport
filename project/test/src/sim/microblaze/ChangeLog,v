@sim: use AM_MAINTAINER_MODE

I noticed the sim code is using an old implementation of the maintainer logic.
I cut it over to the new macro (like gdb has been doing).  In practice, it
makes no difference currently as nothing in the sim tree uses it, but I have a
follow up commit for the Blackfin tree that needs it.

@Define PACKAGE macro in all sims' config.h.

Some of the common includes in include/gdb such as callback.h
include bfd.h.  But there was a recent change in bfd-in.h to
require that config.h be included before bfd.h can be included:

    /* PR 14072: Ensure that config.h is included first.  */
    #if !defined PACKAGE && !defined PACKAGE_VERSION
    #error config.h must be included before this header
    #endif

PACKAGE_VERSION is always defined by default by the AC_INIT autoconf
macro, but PACKAGE isn't.  This patch updates the SIM_AC_COMMON macro
to define it, and then regenerates all configure scripts and config.in
files.

@[PATCH] sim: make sure to include strsignal prototype

Before POSIX standardized strsignal(), old systems would hide the
prototype unless the normal extension defines were enabled.  So use
the AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS helper for that.

Then make sure we include string.h ourselves in nrun.c rather than
relying on implicit includes via other sim headers.

@sim: generate build dependencies on the fly

Lift the code that GDB is using to generate dependencies on the fly and
port it over to the sim.  Now people shouldn't have to manually maintain
these in their Makefile's.

@sim: rename common/aclocal.m4 to common/acinclude.m4

Automake likes to dump macros automatically used into the aclocal.m4
file, but the common/aclocal.m4 naming prevents that.  So rename it
to the more normal "acinclude.m4" so the aclocal tool can work.

@sim: move from common.m4 to SIM_AC_COMMON

Now that the sourceware tree generally requires autoconf-2.64, update
the sim tree to require that too.

This allows us to drop the long standing SIM_AC_COMMON/common.m4
workaround as autoconf 2.64+ seems to work for me.

@sim: add sim_complete_command stubs for non-common-using ports

For the ports that don't use the common/ subdir, we need to add stub funcs
to them to avoid build failures with gdb and command completion.  These do
not implement the actual completion functionality ... any port that wants
that can either convert to the common/ subdir, or fill out the function on
their own time.

@sim: constify sim_write source buffer (part 2)

As pointed out by Sandra Loosemore, a bunch of targets define sim_write
themselves instead of using the common/ code.  So constify them too.
