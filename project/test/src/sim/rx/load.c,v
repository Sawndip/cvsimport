@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.

/* A note about endianness and swapping...

   The RX chip is CISC-like in that the opcodes are variable length
   and are read as a stream of bytes.  However, the chip itself shares
   the code prefetch block with the data fetch block, so when it's
   configured for big endian mode, the memory fetched for opcodes is
   word-swapped.  To compensate for this, the ELF file has the code
   sections pre-swapped.  Our BFD knows this, and for the convenience
   of all the other tools, hides this swapping at a very low level.
   I.e.  it swaps words on the way out and on the way back in.

   Fortunately the iovector routines are unaffected by this, so we
   can use them to read in the segments directly, without having
   to worry about byte swapping anything.

   However, our opcode decoder and disassemblers need to swap the data
   after reading it from the chip memory, just like the chip does.
   All in all, the code words are swapped four times between the
   assembler and our decoder.

   If the chip is running in little-endian mode, no swapping is done
   anywhere.  Note also that the *operands* within opcodes are always
   encoded in little-endian format.  */
