@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.

@sim: include sim-options.h for command prototype

The sim_args_command prototype is in sim-options.h, so pull it in
directly rather than assuming a common header does it.

@sim: start a unified sim_do_command

Since sim_do_command for many people simply calls sim_args_command, start
a unified version of it.  For people who handle their own options, they
could switch to this by using sim_add_option_table instead.
