@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.

@sim: cfi: new flash device simulation

This simulates a CFI flash.  Its pretty configurable via the device
tree.  For now, only basic read/write/erase operations are supported
for the Intel command set, but it's easy enough to extend support.
It's certainly enough to trick Das U-Boot into using it for probing,
reading, writing, and erasing.
