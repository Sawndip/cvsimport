@sim: use AM_MAINTAINER_MODE

I noticed the sim code is using an old implementation of the maintainer logic.
I cut it over to the new macro (like gdb has been doing).  In practice, it
makes no difference currently as nothing in the sim tree uses it, but I have a
follow up commit for the Blackfin tree that needs it.

@[PATCH] sim: make sure to include strsignal prototype

Before POSIX standardized strsignal(), old systems would hide the
prototype unless the normal extension defines were enabled.  So use
the AC_USE_SYSTEM_EXTENSIONS helper for that.

Then make sure we include string.h ourselves in nrun.c rather than
relying on implicit includes via other sim headers.

@sim: generate build dependencies on the fly

Lift the code that GDB is using to generate dependencies on the fly and
port it over to the sim.  Now people shouldn't have to manually maintain
these in their Makefile's.
