// This is an alternate version of the source file two_file_test_1b.cc,
// used to test incremental linking.  We build a binary first using this
// source file, then do an incremental link with the primary version of
// the file.

// This file is used as part of a mixed PIC/non-PIC test.
// Files 1 and 1b are linked together in a shared library.
// File 1 is compiled non-PIC, and file 1a is compiled PIC.
// File 2 is compiled PIC and linked in a second shared library.
// This tests that a non-PIC call does not accidentally get
// bound to a PIC PLT entry.

// We test the following cases.

#include "two_file_test.h"

// 16 Call a function directly after its address has been taken.
