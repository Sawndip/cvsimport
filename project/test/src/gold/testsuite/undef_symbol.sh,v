@2009-02-06  Chris Demetriou  <cgd@@google.com>

	* gold.h (gold_undefined_symbol): Change to take only a Symbol
	pointer and to report location as the file name associated with
	the symbol.
	(gold_undefined_symbol_at_location): New function to replace the
	old gold_undefined_symbol functionality.
	* target-reloc.h (relocate_section): Update to use
	gold_undefined_symbol_at_location.
	* symtab.cc (Symbol_table::warn_about_undefined_dynobj_symbol):
	Call gold_undefined_symbol function rather than gold_error.
	* errors.h (Errors::undefined_symbol): Take location as a
	string, rather than calculating it from a relocation.
	* errors.cc (Errors::fatal): Print "fatal error:" before the
	formatted message.
	(Errors::error, Errors::error_at_location): Print "error: "
	before the formatted message.
	(Errors::undefined_symbol): Take location as a string, rather
	than calculating it from a relocation.
	(gold_undefined_symbol_at_location): New function akin to
	old gold_undefined_symbol, calculates location from relocation.
	(gold_undefined_symbol): Change to take only a Symbol pointer
	and to report location as the file name associated with the symbol.
	* testsuite/debug_msg.sh: Update for changed error messages.
	* testsuite/undef_symbol.sh: Likewise.
