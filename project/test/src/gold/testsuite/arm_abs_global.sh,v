log
@2010-02-11  Doug Kwan  <dougkwan@@google.com>

	* arm.cc (Target_arm::Scan::local): Fix bugs in relocation handling.
	(Target_arm::Scan::global): Ditto.  Also remove a comment before the
	beginning of function.
	(Target_arm::Relocate::relocate): Remove error messages for MOVW_ABS
	and MOVT_ABS relocations.  Those are non issued in scanning.  Fix
	parameter is_32bit in calls to should_apply_static_reloc.
	* testsuite/Makefile.am (check_SCRIPTS): Add arm_abs_global.sh.
	(check_DATA): Add arm_abs_global.stdout.
	(arm_abs_lib.o, libarm_abs.so, arm_abs_global.o, arm_abs_global,
	arm_abs_global.stdout): New rules.
	(MOSTLLYCLEANFILES): Add arm_abs_global
	* Makefile.in: Regenerate.
	* testsuite/arm_abs_global.s: New file.
	* testsuite/arm_abs_global.sh: Ditto.
	* testsuite/arm_abs_lib.s: Ditto.
