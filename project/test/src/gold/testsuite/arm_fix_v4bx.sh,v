	* arm.cc (Target_arm::scan_reloc_for_stub): Move code handling
	R_ARM_V4BX to Target_arm::scan_reloc_section_for_stubs.
	(Target_arm::scan_reloc_section_for_stubs): Instead of calling
	scan_reloc_for_stub, do all processing of R_ARM_V4BX here.
	* options.cc (General_options::General_options): Initialize member
	fix_v4bx_.
	* testsuite/Makefile.am (check_SCRIPTS): Add arm_fix_v4bx.sh
	(check_DATA): Add arm_fix_v4bx.stdout, arm_fix_v4bx_interworking.stdout
	and rm_no_fix_v4bx.stdout
	(arm_fix_v4bx.stdout, arm_fix_v4bx, arm_fix_v4bx.o,
	arm_fix_v4bx_interworking.stdout, arm_fix_v4bx_interworking,
	arm_no_fix_v4bx.stdout, arm_no_fix_v4bx): New make rules.
	(MOSTLYCLEANFILES): Add arm_fix_v4bx, arm_fix_v4bx_interworking
	and arm_no_fix_v4bx.
	* Makefile.in: Regenerate.
