@	* loadlib.h: New header implementing safe LoadLibrary calls.
	Include throughout files using LoadLibrary function.
	* cygcheck.cc (dump_sysinfo): Retrieve kernel32.dll handle via
	GetModuleHandle, rather than using LoadLibrary.
	* cygpath.cc (get_long_name): Ditto.
	(do_sysfolders): Append .dll suffix in LoadLibrary call.
	* ldh.cc (WinMain): Use LoadLibraryExW with DONT_RESOLVE_DLL_REFERENCES
	to avoid loading malicious library code.
	* locale.cc (print_locale_with_codeset): Change way to retrieve
	kernel32.dll path.
