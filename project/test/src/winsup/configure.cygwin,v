	looping.

2012-11-22  Christopher Faylor  <me.cygwin2012@@cgf.cx>

	* Makefile.in: Revamp for new configury.
	(datarootdir): Add variable setting.
	(winver_stamp): Accommodate changes to mkvers.sh setting.
	(libc.a): Fix race when libm.a might not have been built yet.
	* configure.in: Revamp for new configury.
	* aclocal.m4: Regenerate.
	* configure: Ditto.
	* autogen.sh: New script.
	* mkvers.sh: Find include directives via CFLAGS and friends rather than
	assuming that w32api lives nearby.

	* aclocal.m4: Regenerate.
	* configure: Ditto.

	(all): Define target first, before everything else so that it is the
	default.
	(ps.exe): Don't add useless -lcygwin.
	(ldh.exe): For consistency, add to existing MINGW_LDFLAGS rather than
	redefining them.
	(cygcheck.exe): Always include -lz for MINGW_LDFLAGS.  Don't try to
	figure out where to find it.
	(dumper.exe): Simplify check.  Assume libraries are installed rather
	than trying to retrieve from source tree.
	(install): Just use /bin/mkdir to create directories.
	(Makefile): Regenerate when standard dependencies change.
	* dump_setup.cc: Always include zlib.h.  Remove accommodations for it
	possibly not existing.
	* parse_pe.cc: Add define which allows building with installed
	binutils package.
	* dumper.cc: Ditto.
