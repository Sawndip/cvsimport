@What's new:
-----------

- New API: getmntent_r, memrchr.

- Support ReFS.

Bug fixes:
----------

- Fix pipe creation problem which manifested as a problem creating a
  fifo.  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-05/msg00253.html

- Fix hang when calling pthread_testcancel in a canceled thread.
  Fixes some of: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-05/msg00186.html

- Fix invocation of strace from a cygwin process.  Fixes:
  http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-05/msg00292.html

- Fix hang when zero bytes are written to a pty using
  Windows WriteFile or equivalent.  Fixes:
  http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-05/msg00323.html

- Fix recv, recvfrom, recvmsg behaviour if a 0 bytes buffer is given
  as argument.  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-05/msg00332.html

- Handle inode numbers returned by Samba >= 3.5.4. 
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-05/msg00236.html

- Fix emacs problem which exposed an issue with Cygwin's select() function.
  If a signal arrives while select is blocking and the program longjmps
  out of the signal handler then threads and memory may be left hanging.
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-05/threads.html#00275

- Fix fileno(3) to return -1/EBADF if stream is closed.
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-07/msg00083.html

- Fix clipboard handling, at least partially:
  http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-06/msg00521.html

1.7
log
@* DevNotes: Add entry cgf-000010.
* select.cc (set_handle_or_return_if_not_open): Remove unneeded final backslash
from definition.
(cygwin_select): Reorganize to incorporate outer retry loop.  Move remaining
time recalculation here for retry case.  Use select_stuff::wait_states for loop
control.
(select_stuff::cleanup): Avoid unneeded initialization.
(select_stuff::wait): Modify definition to return select_stuff::wait_states.
Eliminate is_cancelable.  Don't element 1 of an array if it is a cancel handle.
Remove loop.  Rely on being called from enclosing loop in cygwin_select.
Remove time recalculation when restarting.  Try harder to always return from
the bottom.
* select.h (select_stuff::wait_state): New enum.
(select_stuff::wait): Modify declaration to return select_stuff::wait_states.

checking for PIPE_ADD_PID.  Properly keep track of len so that passed in name
is not overwritten.
