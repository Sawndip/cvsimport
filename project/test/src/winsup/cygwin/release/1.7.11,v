@What's new:
-----------

- New pldd command for listing DLLs loaded by a process.

- New API: scandirat.


What changed:
-------------

- Fixed problem where background Cygwin processes kept the windows
  console window from exiting.

- Change the way remote shares mapped to drive letters are recognized
  when creating the cygdrive directory.  If Windows claims the drive
  is unavailable, don't show it in the cygdrive directory listing.

- Lower the stack pressure in some Cygwin calls by reducing the buffer
  space allocated on the stack.

- Raise default stacksize of pthreads from 512K to 1 Meg.  It can still
  be changed using the pthread_attr_setstacksize call.

- process.h header has been moved back from /usr/include/cygwin to
  /usr/include.

- Make <sys/wait.h> header C++ clean.
