@What's new:
-----------

- Add mouse reporting mode 1005, 1006 and 1015 to console.

Bug fixes:
----------

- Allow access of /dev/conin, /dev/conout, and /dev/console if a console
  device is detected.

- Always allow nonexistent on-disk devices to be referenced even if they
  can't be open.

- Allow inheritance of special types like /dev/clipboard or /dev/urandom
  which do not have actual handles associated with them.

- Fix inode numbers of non-device files in virtual filesystems.

- Fix reporting large mouse coordinates in console window mouse reporting mode.
