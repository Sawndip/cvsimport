@What changed:
-------------

- Don't create native symlinks with target paths having long path prefixes
  "\\?\" if the target path is shorter than MAX_PATH characters.  This works
  around a Windows 8.1 bug:  The ShellExecuteW fails if the lpFile parameter
  points to a native NTFS symlink with a target path prefixed with "\\?\".
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-12/msg00101.html


Bug Fixes
---------

- Some devices, like, /dev/dsp are no longer detected due to the new
  use of \Device\Null for devices which have no real handle.
  Fixes: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-12/threads.html#00000

- Cygwin could easily run out of file handles.
