@What's new:
-----------


What changed:
-------------

- Change magic number associated with process information block so that 32-bit
  Cygwin processes don't try to interpret 64-bit information and vice-versa.

- Redefine content of mtget tape info struct to allow fetching the number of
  partitions on a tape.


Bug fixes:
----------

- Fix creating two partitions on tape drives supporting initiator partitions.

- Update the internally used blocksize after setting a new blocksize for the
  current tape.

- Fix problem with queued signals as manifested by:
  http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2013-08/msg00534.html

- Fix bug in sbrk breaking extending the heap beyond its default size.

- Disable code which disallowed to start 32 bit Cygwin processes from 64 bit
  Cygwin processes and vice versa.  32 bit processes are not recognized as
  Cygwin processes by a 64 bit parent process and vice versa, so there is
  no IPC other than what you have with non-Cygwin processes.
