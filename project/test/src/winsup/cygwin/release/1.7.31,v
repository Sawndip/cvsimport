@What changed:
-------------

- Improve performance of send(2), sendto(2), sendmsg(2) when using small
  input buffers.
  Addresses: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-07/msg00069.html

- The default pthread_mutex type is now PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL, rather than
  PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK, just as on Linux.

- Align pthread_attr stack functions more closely to Linux.

- Mark pthread_attr_getstackaddr and pthread_attr_setstackaddr as deprecated,
  as on Linux.


Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix various assorted bugs (potential buffer overruns, resource leaks, you
  name it) caught by Coverity.

- Fix return value of getgrouplist if the number of groups is bigger than the
  application-provided buffer can hold.
  See https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-05/msg00469.html

- Fix a spurious error condition in calls to getaddrinfo on x86_64.
  Addresses: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-06/msg00350.html

- Workaround a problem following native NTFS symlinks.  This patch has been
  not applied to 1.7.30, accidentally.
  Addresses: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-04/msg00384.html

- Fix an off-by-one bug in res_querydomain.
  Addresses: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-07/msg00052.html

- Don't catch STATUS_STACK_OVERFLOW preliminary on 64 bit.
  Fixes: https://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2014-07/msg00046.html

- Make sure that signals are properly delivered when sending lots of signals
  in succession.

- Introduce reading passwd/group entries directly from SAM/AD, thus allowing
  to do without /etc/passwd and /etc/group files.  Introduce /etc/nsswitch.conf
  file to configure passwd/group handling.
