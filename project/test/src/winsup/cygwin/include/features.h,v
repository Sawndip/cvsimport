     _BSD_SOURCE   to include pure BSD functions which are not defined
		   under POSIX.

     _POSIX_SOURCE if the application requests a POSIX compatible system.

     _XOPEN_SOURCE if X/Open functions and datatypes are requested.  This
		   option includes _POSIX_SOURCE.

     _GNU_SOURCE   to turn on GNU extensions which might collide with defines
