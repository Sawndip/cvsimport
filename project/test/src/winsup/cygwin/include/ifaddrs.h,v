@	* autoload.cc (WSAIoctl): Remove.
	* cygwin.din: Export freeifaddrs, getifaddrs.
	* fhandler_socket.cc (fhandler_socket::ioctl): Drop SOCKET parameter
	from get_ifconf.
	* net.cc: Include ifaddrs.h.
	(in_are_prefix_equal): Match addresses in network byte order.
	(ip_addr_prefix): Convert address into host byte order before
	testing with IN_LOOPBACK.
	(struct ifall): Define.
	(get_xp_ifs): Replace get_xp_ifconf.  Return struct ifall array.
	(get_2k_ifs): Ditto, replace get_2k_ifconf.
	(get_nt_ifs): Ditto, replace get_nt_ifconf.
	(getifaddrs): New function.
	(freeifaddrs): New function.
	(get_ifconf): Call matching get_XX_ifs function and create
	ifc content from here.  Drop lo fake since it's now in get_nt_ifs.
	* posix.sgml: Add freeifaddrs and getifaddrs to list of implemented
	BSD functions.
	* wincap.h (wincapc::has_broken_if_oper_status): New element.
