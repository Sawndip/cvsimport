/*
 *  SYSEXITS.H -- Exit status codes for system programs.
 *
 *      This include file attempts to categorize possible error
 *      exit statuses for system programs, notably delivermail
 *      and the Berkeley network.
 *
 *      Error numbers begin at EX__BASE to reduce the possibility of
 *      clashing with other exit statuses that random programs may
 *      already return.  The meaning of the codes is approximately
 *      as follows:
 *
 *      EX_USAGE -- The command was used incorrectly, e.g., with
 *              the wrong number of arguments, a bad flag, a bad
 *              syntax in a parameter, or whatever.
 *      EX_DATAERR -- The input data was incorrect in some way.
 *              This should only be used for user's data & not
 *              system files.
 *      EX_NOINPUT -- An input file (not a system file) did not
 *              exist or was not readable.  This could also include
 *              errors like "No message" to a mailer (if it cared
 *              to catch it).
 *      EX_NOUSER -- The user specified did not exist.  This might
 *              be used for mail addresses or remote logins.
 *      EX_NOHOST -- The host specified did not exist.  This is used
 *              in mail addresses or network requests.
 *      EX_UNAVAILABLE -- A service is unavailable.  This can occur
 *              if a support program or file does not exist.  This
 *              can also be used as a catchall message when something
 *              you wanted to do doesn't work, but you don't know
 *              why.
 *      EX_SOFTWARE -- An internal software error has been detected.
 *              This should be limited to non-operating system related
 *              errors as possible.
 *      EX_OSERR -- An operating system error has been detected.
 *              This is intended to be used for such things as "cannot
 *              fork", "cannot create pipe", or the like.  It includes
 *              things like getuid returning a user that does not
 *              exist in the passwd file.
 *      EX_OSFILE -- Some system file (e.g., /etc/passwd, /etc/utmp,
 *              etc.) does not exist, cannot be opened, or has some
 *              sort of error (e.g., syntax error).
 *      EX_CANTCREAT -- A (user specified) output file cannot be
 *              created.
 *      EX_IOERR -- An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.
 *      EX_TEMPFAIL -- temporary failure, indicating something that
 *              is not really an error.  In sendmail, this means
 *              that a mailer (e.g.) could not create a connection,
 *              and the request should be reattempted later.
 *      EX_PROTOCOL -- the remote system returned something that
 *              was "not possible" during a protocol exchange.
 *      EX_NOPERM -- You did not have sufficient permission to
 *              perform the operation.  This is not intended for
 *              file system problems, which should use NOINPUT or
 *              CANTCREAT, but rather for higher level permissions.
