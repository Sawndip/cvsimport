* mkglobals_h: Ditto for generated globals.h file.
* globals.cc: Use specific NO_GLOBALS_H flag to control inclusion of globals.h.
* winsup.h: Honor NO_GLOBALS_H to control inclusion of globals.h.  Make
clear_procimptoken extern inline so that it is only defined when needed.

	pipe name.
	* shared.cc (installation_root): Define here for storage in DLL
	common shared memory.

	(get_session_parent_dir): Ditto.
	(shared_info::initialize): Move call to init_installation_root from

	(CURR_SHARED_MAGIC): Ditto.
	(class shared_info): Remove definition of installation_root and
	declaration of init_installation_root.
