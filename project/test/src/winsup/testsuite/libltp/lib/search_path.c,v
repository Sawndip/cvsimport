 * 
 *    UNICOS Feature Test and Evaluation - Cray Research, Inc.
 * 
 *    FUNCTION NAME 	: search_path 
 * 
 *    FUNCTION TITLE	: search PATH locations for desired filename
 * 
 *    SYNOPSIS:
 *	int search_path(cmd, res_path, access_mode, fullpath)
 *	char *cmd;
 *	char *res_path;
 *	int access_mode;
 *	int fullpath;
 * 
 *    AUTHOR		: Richard Logan
 * 
 *    INITIAL RELEASE	: UNICOS 7.0
 * 
 *    DESCRIPTION
 *	Search_path will walk through PATH and attempt to find "cmd".  If cmd is
 *	a full or relative path, it is checked but PATH locations are not scanned.
 *	search_path will put the resulting path in res_path.  It is assumed
 *	that res_path points to a string that is at least PATH_MAX
 *	(or MAXPATHLEN on the suns) in size.  Access_mode is just as is
 *	says, the mode to be used on access to determine if cmd can be found.
 *	If fullpath is set, res_path will contain the full path to cmd.
 *	If it is not set, res_path may or may not contain the full path to cmd.
 *	If fullpath is not set, the path in PATH prepended to cmd is used,
 *	which could be a relative path.  If fullpath is set, the current
 *	directory is prepended to path/cmd before access is called.
 *	If cmd is found, search_path will return 0.  If cmd cannot be
 *	found, 1 is returned.  If an error has occurred, -1 is returned
 *	and an error mesg is placed in res_path. 
 *	If the length of path/cmd is larger then PATH_MAX, then that path
 *	location is skipped.
 *
