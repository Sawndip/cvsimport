/*
 * On-disk structure of a wlog_rec.  Actually, the record consists of
 * 3 parts:  [wlog_rec_disk structure][variable length data][length]
 * where length is a 2 byte field containing the total record length
 * (including the 2 bytes).  It is used for scanning the logfile in reverse
 * order.
 *
 * The variable length data includes the path, host, and pattern (in that
 * order).  The lengths of these pieces of data are held in the
 * wlog_rec_disk structure.  Thus, the actual on-disk record looks like
 * this (top is lower byte offset):
 *
 *		struct wlog_rec_disk
 *		path    (w_pathlen bytes - not null terminated)
 *		host    (w_hostlen bytes - not null terminated)
 *		pattern (w_patternlen bytes - not null terminated)
 *		2-byte record length
 *
 * Another way of looking at it is:
 *
 * <struct wlog_rec_disk><path (wpathlen bytes)>-->
 * --><host (w_hostlen bytes)><pattern (w_patternlen bytes)><length (2 bytes)>
 *
 * The maximum length of this record is defined by the WLOG_REC_MAX_SIZE
 * record.  Note that the 2-byte record length forces this to be
 * <= 64k bytes.
 *
 * Note that there is lots of bit-masking done here.  The w_pathlen,
 * w_hostlen, and w_patternlen fields MUST have enough bits to hold
 * WLOG_MAX_PATH, WLOG_MAX_HOST, and WLOG_MAX_PATTERN bytes respectivly.
