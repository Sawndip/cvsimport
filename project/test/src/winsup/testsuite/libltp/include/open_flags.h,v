/***********************************************************************
 * This function attempts to convert open flag bits into human readable
 * symbols (i.e. O_TRUNC).  If there are more than one symbol,
 * the <sep> string will be placed as a separator between symbols.
 * Commonly used separators would be a comma "," or pipe "|".
 * If <mode> is one and not all <openflags> bits can be converted to
 * symbols, the "UNKNOWN" symbol will be added to return string.
 * 
 * Return Value
 * openflags2symbols will return the indentified symbols.
 * If no symbols are recognized the return value will be a empty
 * string or the "UNKNOWN" symbol.
 *
 * Limitations
 * Currently (05/96) all known symbols are coded into openflags2symbols.
 * If new open flags are added this code will have to updated
 * to know about them or they will not be recognized.
 *
 * The Open_symbols must be large enough to hold all possible symbols
 * for a given system.
 *

/***********************************************************************
 * This function will take a string of comma separated open flags symbols
 * and translate them into an open flag bitmask.
 * If any symbol is not valid, -1 is returned.  On this error condition

 * to the beginning location of where the invalid symbol was found.
 * string will be returned unchanged. 
 *
 * A signal received while parsing string could cause the string to
 * contain a NULL character in the middle of it.
