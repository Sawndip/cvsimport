 * File: cancel4.c
 *
 * Test Synopsis: Test cancelation does not occur in deferred
 *                cancelation threads with no cancelation points.
 *
 * Test Method (Validation or Falsification):
 * - 
 *
 * Requirements Tested:

 *
 * Cases Tested:
 * - 
 *
 * Description:
 * - 
 *
 * Environment:

 *
 * Input:
 * - None.
 *
 * Output:
 * - File name, Line number, and failed expression on failure.
 * - No output on success.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - pthread_create
 *   pthread_self
 *   pthread_cancel
 *   pthread_join
 *   pthread_setcancelstate
 *   pthread_setcanceltype

 *
 * Fail Criteria:
 * - Process returns non-zero exit status.
