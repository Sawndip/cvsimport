@The cygwin-doc source files are kept in CVS. Please see
https://cygwin.com/cvs.html for more information.

BUILD REQUIREMENTS:

bash
bzip2
coreutils
cygwin
dblatex
docbook-xml45
docbook-xsl
gzip
make
texinfo
perl
xmlto


OTHER NOTES:

You may use docbook2X to convert the DocBook files into info pages.
I have not been able to get a working docbook2X installation on Cygwin,
so currently I convert the files on a machine running GNU/Linux.

A few handmade files (cygwin.texi, intro.3, etc.) are found in the
cygwin-doc-x.y-z-src.tar.bz2 package. It also contains the utilities for
building the cygwin-doc-x.y-z "binary" package--simply run each step in
the cygwin-doc-x.y-z.sh script.

1.3
log
@* Makefile.in: Use "xmlto pdf" instead of docbook2pdf.
Force the dblatex backend, as the default passivetex does not work.
* README: Replace docbook-utils dependency with dblatex.
Update required docbook-xml version.
* faq-programming.xml: Ditto.

so currently I convert the files on a machine running GNU/Linux. PDF
generation is also problematic; I use 'jw -b pdf' right now but have
also used 'xmlto pdf' and jade.
