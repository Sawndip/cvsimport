This might get fixed someday, but meanwhile, just use rxvt, which does
not have this problem.  This is no real loss, because rxvt has many
other advantages.  (Do not attempt to use the "broken" pipe key
(@@samp{¦}) as a substitute, it is a different character.)

There is a rare core-dump that seems to be triggered by a recursive

during parallel makes (@@code{make -j 3}).  The solution is not known,
so please help debug this.  ``Me too'' reports are not useful, unless

For now you'll just have to kill them manually.

This is a difficult problem, related to the implementation of select()

mailing list.  For an excellent technical description of the problem, see

@@section Linking with -lm or -lc leads to crash
a4 36
Currently, @@code{/usr/lib/libm.a} and @@code{/usr/lib/libc.a} are
symbolic links to libcygwin.a, where this stuff is actually implemented.
You need not explicitly link with -lm or -lc.

In fact, you @@strong{must not} link with -lm or -lc, or your application
will crash.  This is a bug, and it is being worked on.

Providing empty stub libraries for libm.a and libc.a is not considered
workable, because some packages look for symbols there.

There are some discussions of this in the mailing list.  See

@@strong{(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)}

While this problem may have been worse under B19, Control-c's in bash
under Win 95 may still be able to lock up the Win 95 kernel, freezing
your machine.  This problem can be fixed if you are running the OSR2
version of Win 95 by installing the USB patch available on OSR2 CDs or
on MSDN subscription CDs.  More information about OSR2 and the USB patch
is available from @@file{http://www.compuclinic.com/osr2faq/index.html}.

@@section Some programs can't deal with // pathname scheme in arguments

@@strong{(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)}

gcc and other tools aren't fully compatible with the current pathname
scheme: it can't grok an argument of -I//d/foo which means it is vital
that when attempting to configure/build UNIX packages, that only normal
paths with single slashes are used.
