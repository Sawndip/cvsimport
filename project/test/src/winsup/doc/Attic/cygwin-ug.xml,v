1.2
log
@Removed setup.xml and cygwin-ug.xml: they were not inputs to any of the
documentation outputs.  Apparently they were the predecessors of
setup-net.xml and cygwin-ug-net.xml.  I don't know if for a time there
were parallel versions of the manuals and one fork died, or if the cutover
was clean and the old versions were just never removed.  Either way,
they're dead junk now.

@Modernized user guide, API reference, and FAQ generation.  Overall
effect is to move away from DocBook SGML and DJ Delorie's doctool and
toward pure DocBook XSL.  (There remains just one use of doctool, and
we have plans for replacing it, too.)  See ChangeLog for details.
