1.2
log
@Reverted XInclude in cygwin-api.in.xml from an XInclude to a DOCTOOL
include.  You can't mix the two fragment inclusion mechanisms within
a single document because of the way it interacts with autoconf "build
in separate tree" mechanism.  Either work separately, but they fail when
you try to use them together due to the way doctool chooses output
directories for its generated files.

1.1
log
@Modernized user guide, API reference, and FAQ generation.  Overall
effect is to move away from DocBook SGML and DJ Delorie's doctool and
toward pure DocBook XSL.  (There remains just one use of doctool, and
we have plans for replacing it, too.)  See ChangeLog for details.
