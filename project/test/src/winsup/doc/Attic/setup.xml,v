1.2
log
@Removed setup.xml and cygwin-ug.xml: they were not inputs to any of the
documentation outputs.  Apparently they were the predecessors of
setup-net.xml and cygwin-ug-net.xml.  I don't know if for a time there
were parallel versions of the manuals and one fork died, or if the cutover
was clean and the old versions were just never removed.  Either way,
they're dead junk now.

<para>The following packages are included in the native Win32
release of GNUPro:</para>

<para>GNUPro development tools: binutils, bison, byacc, dejagnu,
diff, expect, flex, gas, gcc, gdb, itcl, ld, libstdc++, make, patch,
tcl, tix, tk</para>

<para>GNUPro unsupported tools: ash, bash, bzip2, diff, fileutils,
findutils, gawk, grep, gzip, m4, sed, shellutils, tar, textutils,
time</para>

</sect1>

<sect1 id="installing-binaries"><title>Installing the binary release</title>

<para>Load the GNUPro CD-ROM and run the installer.  It will
take you through the installation process, starting with asking for
your install location.  Once the installation is complete, there will
be a new Program Files folder that you can use to obtain a shell
from which you can run the tools.</para>

<para>There are two remaining thing you should do from this
prompt. First, you need to type <command>mkdir -p /tmp</command> to
ensure that a temp directory exists for programs that expect to find
one there.</para>

<para>Second, depending on how you intend to use the tools, various
programs may need to be able to find `/bin/sh'. You should `mkdir -p
/bin' and put a copy of `sh.exe' there, removing the older version, if
present.  Note that you can use the `mount' utility to select which
drive letter is mounted as `/'.</para>

<para>If you should ever want to uninstall the tools, you may do so
via the "Add/Remove Programs" control panel.</para>

1.1
log
@Modernized user guide, API reference, and FAQ generation.  Overall
effect is to move away from DocBook SGML and DJ Delorie's doctool and
toward pure DocBook XSL.  (There remains just one use of doctool, and
we have plans for replacing it, too.)  See ChangeLog for details.
