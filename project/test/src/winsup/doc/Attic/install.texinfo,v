@@@chapter Installation Instructions
@@section Contents

There is only one recommended way to install Cygwin, which is to use the GUI
installer ``Cygwin Setup''.  It is flexible and easy to use.  
You can pick and choose the packages you wish to install, and update
them individually.  Full source code is available for all packages and
tools.  More information on using Cygwin Setup may be found at
@@file{http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-net.html}.

If you do it any other way, you're on your own!  That said, keep in mind
that the GUI installer is a "work in progress", so there might be a few
difficulties, especially if you are behind a firewall or have other
specific requirements.  If something doesn't work right for you, and
it's not covered here or in the latest development snapshot at
@@file{http://cygwin.com/setup/}, then by all means report it to the
mailing list.

For a searchable list of packages that can be installed with Cygwin,
see @@file{http://cygwin.com/packages/}.

@@section Installation using ``Cygwin Setup''

The Cygwin Setup program is the @@emph{only} recommended way to install
Cygwin. 

@@subsection Why not install in C:\?

The Cygwin Setup program will prompt you for a "root" directory.
The default is @@samp{C:\cygwin}, but you can change it.  You are urged not to
choose something like @@samp{C:\} (the root directory on the system drive) for
your Cygwin root.  If you do, then critical Cygwin system directories
like @@samp{etc}, @@samp{lib} and @@samp{bin} could easily be corrupted by
other (non-Cygwin) applications or packages that use @@samp{\etc},
@@samp{\lib} or @@samp{\bin}.  Perhaps there is no conflict now, but who
knows what you might install in the future?  It's also just good common
sense to segregate your Cygwin "filesystems" from the rest of your
Windows system disk.

(In the past, there had been genuine bugs that would cause problems
for people who installed in @@samp{C:\}, but we believe those are gone
now.)

@@subsection Can I use Cygwin Setup to get old versions of packages (like gcc-2.95)?

Cygwin Setup can be used to install any packages that are on a
Cygwin mirror, which usually includes one version previous to the
current one. The complete list may be searched at 
@@file{http://cygwin.com/packages/}.  There is no complete archive of
older packages. If you have a problem with the current version of
a Cygwin package, please report it to the mailing list using the 
guidelines at @@file{http://cygwin.com/problems.html}.

That said, if you really need an older package, you may be able to find
an outdated or archival mirror by searching the web for an old package
version (for example, @@samp{gcc2-2.95.3-10-src.tar.bz2}), but keep in
mind that this older version will not be supported by the mailing list
and that installing the older version will not help improve Cygwin.

@@subsection Is Cygwin Setup, or one of the packages, infected with a virus?

Unlikely.  Unless you can confirm it, please don't report it to the
mailing list.  Anti-virus products have been known to detect false
positives when extracting compressed tar archives.  If this causes
problems for you, consider disabling your anti-virus software when
running @@code{setup}.  Read the next entry for a fairly safe way to do
this.

@@subsection My computer hangs when I run Cygwin Setup!

Both Network Associates (formerly McAfee) and Norton anti-virus
products have been reported to "hang" when extracting Cygwin tar
archives.  If this happens to you, consider disabling your anti-virus
software when running Cygwin Setup.  The following procedure should be
a fairly safe way to do that:

@@enumerate
@@item Download @@code{setup.exe} and scan it explicitly.

@@item Turn off the anti-virus software.

@@item Run setup to download and extract all the tar files.

@@item Re-activate your anti-virus software and scan everything
in C:\cygwin (or wherever you chose to install), or your entire hard
disk if you are paranoid.

@@end enumerate

This should be safe, but only if Cygwin Setup is not substituted by
something malicious, and no mirror has been compromised.

@@subsection What packages should I download? Where are 'make', 'gcc', 'vi', etc?  
When using Cygwin Setup for the first time, the default is to install
a minimal subset of packages.  If you want anything beyond that, you
will have to select it explicitly.  See
@@file{http://cygwin.com/packages/} for a searchable list of available
packages.

If you want to build programs, of course you'll need @@samp{gcc},
@@samp{binutils}, @@samp{make} and probably other packages from the
``Devel'' category. Text editors can be found under ``Editors''.

@@subsection How do I just get everything?

Long ago, the default was to install everything, much to the
irritation of most users.  Now the default is to install only a basic
core of packages.  Cygwin Setup is designed to make it easy to browse
categories and select what you want to install or omit from those
categories.  It's also easy to install everything:

@@enumerate

@@item At the ``Select Packages'' screen, in ``Categories'' view, at the line 
marked ``All'', click on the word ``default'' so that it changes to
``install''.  (Be patient, there is some computing to do at this step.
It may take a second or two to register the change.)  This tells Setup
to install @@emph{everything}, not just what it thinks you should have
by default.

@@item Now click on the ``View'' button (twice) until you get the
``Partial'' view.  This shows exactly which packages are about to be
downloaded and installed.

@@end enumerate

This procedure only works for packages that are currently available.
There is no way to tell Cygwin Setup to install all packages by
default from now on.  As new packages become available that would not
be installed by default, you have to repeat the above procedure to get
them.

In general, a better method (in my opinion), is to:

@@enumerate

@@item First download & install all packages that would normally be
installed by default.  This includes fundamental packages and any
updates to what you have already installed.  Then...

@@item Run Cygwin Setup again, and apply the above technique to get all
new packages that would not be installed by default.  You can check
the list in the Partial View before proceeding, in case there's
something you really @@emph{don't} want.

@@item In the latest version of Cygwin Setup, if you click the ``View''
button (twice) more, it shows packages not currently installed.  You
ought to check whether you @@emph{really} want to install everything!

@@end enumerate

@@subsection How much disk space does Cygwin require?

That depends, obviously, on what you've chosen to download and
install.  A full installation today is probably larger than 800MB
installed, not including the package archives themselves nor the source
code.

After installation, the package archives remain in your ``Local
Package Directory'', by default the location of @@code{setup.exe}.  You
may conserve disk space by deleting the subdirectories there.  These
directories will have very weird looking names, being encoded with
their URLs.

@@subsection What if setup fails?

First, make sure that you are using the latest version of Cygwin
Setup.  The latest version is always available from the 'Install
Cygwin now' link on the Cygwin Home Page at @@file{http://cygwin.com/}.

If you are downloading from the Internet, setup will fail if it cannot
download the list of mirrors at
@@file{http://cygwin.com/mirrors.html}.  It could be that
the network is too busy.  Something similar could be the cause of a
download site not working.  Try another mirror, or try again later.

If setup refuses to download a package that you know needs to be
upgraded, try deleting that package's entry from /etc/setup.  If you are
reacting quickly to an announcement on the mailing list, it could be
that the mirror you are using doesn't have the latest copy yet.  Try
another mirror, or try again tomorrow.

If setup has otherwise behaved strangely, check the files
@@samp{setup.log} and @@samp{setup.log.full} in @@code{/var/log}
(@@code{C:\cygwin\var\log} by default).  It may provide some clues as
to what went wrong and why.

If you're still baffled, search the Cygwin mailing list for clues.
Others may have the same problem, and a solution may be posted there.
If that search proves fruitless, send a query to the Cygwin mailing
list.  You must provide complete details in your query: version of
setup, options you selected, contents of setup.log and setup.log.full,
what happened that wasn't supposed to happen, etc.

@@subsection My Windows logon name has a space in it, will this cause problems?

Most definitely yes!  UNIX shells (and thus Cygwin) use the space
character as a word delimiter.  Under certain circumstances, it is
possible to get around this with various shell quoting mechanisms, but
you are much better off if you can avoid the problem entirely.

On Windows NT/2000/XP you have two choices:
@@enumerate

@@item You can rename the user in the Windows User Manager GUI and then
run mkpasswd.

@@item You can simply edit the /etc/passwd file and change the Cygwin user name 
(first field). It's also a good idea to avoid spaces in the home directory.

@@end enumerate

On Windows 95/98/ME you can create a new user and run mkpasswd, 
or you can delete the offending entry from /etc/passwd. 
Cygwin will then use the name in the default entry with uid 500.

@@subsection My @@samp{HOME} environment variable is not what I want.

When starting Cygwin from Windows, @@samp{HOME} is determined as follows
in order of decreasing priority:

@@enumerate

@@item @@samp{HOME} from the Windows environment, translated to POSIX form.

@@item The entry in /etc/passwd

@@item @@samp{HOMEDRIVE} and @@samp{HOMEPATH} from the Windows environment

@@item /

@@end enumerate

When using Cygwin from the network (telnet, ssh,...), @@samp{HOME} is set 
from /etc/passwd.

If your @@samp{HOME} is set to a value such as /cygdrive/c, it is likely 
that it was set in Windows. Start a DOS Command Window and type 
"set HOME" to verify if this is the case.

Access to shared drives is often restricted when starting from the network,
thus Domain users may wish to have a different @@samp{HOME} in the 
Windows environment (on shared drive) than in /etc/passwd (on local drive).
Note that ssh only considers /etc/passwd, disregarding @@samp{HOME}. 

@@subsection How do I uninstall individual packages?

Run Cygwin Setup as you would to install packages.  In the list of
packages to install, browse the relevant category or click on the
``View'' button to get a full listing.  Click on the cycle glyph until
the action reads ``Uninstall''.  Proceed by clicking ``Next''.

@@subsection How do I uninstall @@strong{all} of Cygwin?

Setup has no automatic uninstall facility.  The recommended method to remove all 
of Cygwin is as follows:

@@enumerate

@@item Remove all Cygwin services.  If a service is currently running, it must 
first be stopped with @@samp{cygrunsrv -E name}, where @@samp{name} 
is the name of the service.  Then use @@samp{cygrunsrv -R name} to uninstall the 
service from the registry.  Repeat this for all services that you installed.  
Common services that might have been installed are @@code{sshd}, @@code{cron}, 
@@code{cygserver}, @@code{inetd}, @@code{apache}, and so on.

@@item Stop the X11 server if it is running, and terminate any Cygwin programs 
that might be running in the background.  Remove all mount information by typing 
@@samp{umount -A} and then exit the command prompt and ensure that no Cygwin 
processes remain.  Note: If you want to save your mount points for a later 
reinstall, first save the output of @@samp{mount -m} as described at 
@@file{http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-utils.html#mount}.

@@item Delete the Cygwin root folder and all subfolders.  If you get an error 
that an object is in use, then ensure that you've stopped all services and 
closed all Cygwin programs.  If you get a 'Permission Denied' error then you 
will need to modify the permissions and/or ownership of the files or folders 
that are causing the error.  For example, sometimes files used by system 
services end up owned by the SYSTEM account and not writable by regular users.  

The quickest way to delete the entire tree if you run into this problem is to 
change the ownership of all files and folders to your account.  To do this in 
Windows Explorer, right click on the root Cygwin folder, choose Properties, then 
the Security tab.  Select Advanced, then go to the Owner tab and make sure your 
account is listed as the owner.  Select the 'Replace owner on subcontainers and 
objects' checkbox and press Ok.  After Explorer applies the changes you should 
be able to delete the entire tree in one operation.  Note that you can also 
achieve this in Cygwin by typing @@samp{chown -R user /} or by using other tools 
such as CACLS.EXE.

@@item Delete the Cygwin shortcuts on the Desktop and Start Menu, and anything 
left by setup.exe in the download directory.  However, if you plan to reinstall 
Cygwin it's a good idea to keep your setup.exe download directory since you can 
reinstall the packages left in its cache without redownloading them.

@@item If you added Cygwin to your system path, you should remove it unless you 
plan to reinstall Cygwin to the same location.  Similarly, if you set your 
CYGWIN environment variable system-wide and don't plan to reinstall, you should 
remove it.

@@item Finally, if you want to be thorough you can delete the registry tree 
@@samp{Software\Cygnus Solutions} under @@code{HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE} and/or 
@@code{HKEY_CURRENT_USER}.  However, if you followed the directions above you 
will have already removed all the mount information which is typically the only 
thing stored in the registry.

@@end enumerate

@@subsection How do I install snapshots?

First, are you sure you want to do this?  Snapshots are risky.  They
have not been tested.  Use them @@strong{only} if there is a feature or
bugfix that you need to try, and you are willing to deal with any
problems.

Before installing a snapshot, you must first Close @@strong{all} Cygwin
applications, including shells and services (e.g. inetd, sshd), before
updating @@code{cygwin1.dll}.  You may have to restart Windows to clear
the DLL from memory.

You cannot use Setup to install a snapshot.

You should generally install the full
@@code{cygwin-inst-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2} update, rather than just the DLL,
otherwise some components may be out of sync.  Cygwin tar won't be
able to update @@code{/usr/bin/cygwin1.dll}, but it should succeed with
everything else.

@@enumerate

@@item Download the snapshot, and run:
@@example
	cd /
        tar jxvf /posix/path/to/cygwin-inst-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2 --exclude=usr/bin/cygwin1.dll
        cd /tmp
        tar jxvf /posix/path/to/cygwin-inst-YYYYMMDD.tar.bz2 usr/bin/cygwin1.dll
@@end example

@@item After closing all Cygwin apps (see above), use Explorer or the
Windows command shell to move @@code{C:\cygwin\tmp\usr\bin\cygwin1.dll}
to @@code{C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll}.

@@end enumerate

@@subsection Can Cygwin Setup maintain a ``mirror''?

NO.  Cygwin Setup cannot do this for you.  Use a tool designed for
this purpose.  See @@file{http://rsync.samba.org/},
@@file{http://wget.sunsite.dk/} for utilities that can do this for you.
For more information on setting up a custom Cygwin package server, see
the Cygwin Setup homepage at
@@file{http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin-apps/setup.html}.

@@subsection How can I make my own portable Cygwin on CD?

While some users have successfully done this, for example Indiana
University's XLiveCD @@file{http://xlivecd.indiana.edu/}, there is no
easy way to do it. Full instructions for constructing a porttable Cygwin
on CD by hand can be found on the mailing list at
@@file{http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2003-07/msg01117.html}.  (Thanks
to fergus at bonhard dot uklinux dot net for these instructions.)

@@subsection How do I save, restore, delete, or modify the Cygwin information stored in the registry?

Currently Cygwin stores its mount table information in the registry.  It
is recommended that you use the @@samp{mount} and @@samp{umount} commands
to manipulate the mount information instead of directly modifying the
registry.

To save the mount information to a file for later restoration, use
@@samp{mount -m > mounts.bat} To remove all mount information use
@@samp{umount -A}.  To reincorporate saved mount information just run the
batch file. For more information on using @@samp{mount}, see
@@file{http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-utils.html#mount}.

There are a few different ways to install the Cygwin net release, and
we'll try to cover them all here.  It is strongly recommended to use the
automatic @@code{setup.exe} program if you can.
d39 4
a42 7
@@strong{IMPORTANT: If you run @@code{setup.exe} on an existing Cygwin
installation, Setup will overwrite the contents of mounted directories.
There is no recovery from this.  If you are upgrading from an older
version of Cygwin, you may wish to back up your current installation and
unmount old mount points in order to isolate them.  Then you can
re-install Cygwin in a new location with new mount points, if this is
what you want.}
d51 1
a51 1
You have a few options when using @@code{setup.exe}.  
d54 83
a136 193
The default is 'C:\cygwin', but you can change it.  (You are strongly
urged @@strong{not} to choose something like 'C:\'.)  It will contain the
necessary files and directory structure, and will be mounted to '/' as
part of the installation process.

After a new installation in the default location, your mount points will
look something like this:

@@example
Device              Directory           Type         Flags
C:\cygwin\bin       /usr/bin            user         binmode
C:\cygwin\lib       /usr/lib            user         binmode
C:\cygwin           /                   user         binmode
@@end example

Note that /bin and /usr/bin point to the same location, as do /lib and
/usr/lib.  This is intentional, and you should not undo these mounts
unless you @@emph{really} know what you are doing.  Currently,
@@code{setup.exe} creates only binary mounts, but future versions will
probably be more flexible.

You can let @@code{setup.exe} download all the files for you on the fly.
This is the 'internet' installation.  Or you can download all (or some)
of the packages ahead of time, and instruct @@code{setup.exe} to install
Cygwin from those files.  This is the 'directory' installation.  You
must use this method if you want to install only a subset of the
available packages.

Note that you cannot combine methods.  If you use the directory
installation, @@code{setup.exe} will install @@strong{only} the packages
it finds in the directory; it will not also be able to download packages
from the internet in the same pass.  If you have not carefully chosen
which packages to download, you may not end up with a working Cygwin
installation.  You can, however, add and update packages later.  See
below.

Whichever you choose, the first step is to open an ftp mirror site near
you from @@file{http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/mirrors.html}.  Then
go to the 'latest' directory, download @@code{setup.exe} and save that to
an @@strong{empty temporary directory}.  While you're there, download the
README file and read it.  Then read it again.

Then proceed according to your choice below.

@@subsection Internet installation with @@code{setup.exe}

Shut down @@strong{all cygwin applications} (including inetd, etc.).

Then, in a @@strong{Windows command prompt} ("MS-DOS Prompt" in Windows
95/98), '@@code{cd}' to the temporary directory and type
'@@code{setup.exe}'.

When prompted, specify the location of the root directory, or accept the
default.

At the next prompt, choose to install from the Internet ('i').  This is
the default.

Setup will connect to sources.redhat.com to read a list of mirror
sites.  Choose one from the list, or choose 'other' to supply your own.
If you supply your own, you must provide a full URL, not just the ftp
hostname.  Setup will then proceed to download and install all packages
from the ftp site.  Of course this may take a while if you have a slow
connection.

When finished, Setup will have created a "Cygnus Solutions" folder on
your Start Menu, containing a shortcut to @@code{cygwin.bat}, which
invokes bash with various environment variables set correctly.  The
"Uninstall Cygwin" shortcut, if present, is unlikely to do a proper
job.  If you want to completely uninstall Cygwin, you will probably have
to delete some things by hand.

Once setup is complete you may remove the temporary directory.  It will
contain @@code{setup.exe}, the downloaded @@code{.tar.gz} files, and a
setup log file, which is not needed, but may contain helpful diagnostics
if your installation failed for some reason.

@@subsection Directory installation with @@code{setup.exe}

Before proceeding, you must download packages into the temporary
directory containing @@code{setup.exe}.  These are in subdirectories of
'latest' and end in .tar.gz and not in -src.tar.gz.  If there is more
than one in a given directory, pick the one with the highest version
number.  Put them together in the temporary directory containing
@@code{setup.exe}.  You may preserve the directory structure of 'latest',
and include the -src.tar.gz files, without ill effect.

Whatever subset you think is appropriate, it @@strong{must} contain the
'cygwin' package, or you will not end up with a working Cygwin
installation.

When you have all the necessary tar files together with
@@code{setup.exe}, proceed as you would for an internet installation,
except choose directory installation ('d') when prompted.  Setup will
install all the tar files that it finds there.  Here are the gory
details again:

Shut down @@strong{all cygwin applications} (including inetd, etc.).

Then, in a @@strong{Windows command prompt} ("MS-DOS Prompt" in Windows
95/98), '@@code{cd}' to the temporary directory and type
'@@code{setup.exe}'.

When prompted, specify the location of the root directory, or accept the
default.

At the next prompt, choose to install from the current directory ('d').
This is @@strong{not} the default.

When finished, Setup will have created a "Cygnus Solutions" folder on
your Start Menu, containing a shortcut to @@code{cygwin.bat}, which
invokes bash with various environment variables set correctly.  The
"Uninstall Cygwin" shortcut, if present, is unlikely to do a proper
job.  If you want to completely uninstall Cygwin, you will probably have
to delete some things by hand.

Once setup is complete you may remove the temporary directory.  It will
contain @@code{setup.exe}, the downloaded @@code{.tar.gz} files, and a
setup log file, which is not needed, but may contain helpful diagnostics
if your installation failed for some reason.

@@subsection Adding or updating packages

Later versions of @@code{setup.exe} permit you to add and/or update
packages to an existing cygwin installation.

@@strong{You cannot use this method to update a B18, B19, B20, B20.1 or
CD-ROM (1.0) installation of Cygwin.  You must have previously installed
a net release of Cygwin 1.1.0 or greater, using @@code{setup.exe}, before
you can update packages with 'setup -u'.}

To update your installation, create an empty temporary directory, and
download the latest version of @@code{setup.exe} to it from a Cygwin
mirror near you.

Then, in a @@strong{Windows command prompt} ("MS-DOS Prompt" in Windows
95/98), '@@code{cd}' to the temporary directory and type
@@example
	setup -u <pkg>
@@end example
where "<pkg>" is the name of the package you wish to update, such as
"cygwin" or "gdb" or "make" or ...

Specify the root directory as you did when you first installed Cygwin.
This will update the package.  As with the initial installation, you can
update from the internet ('i') or from the directory ('d').  The latter
requires that you download the @@code{.tar.gz} file of the package ahead
of time, along with @@code{setup.exe}.

If you are updating the package "cygwin", then you must close
@@strong{all} Cygwin applications (including @@code{inetd}, for example),
before running setup.

You can omit the '-u' option, which will force setup to install the
latest package (from internet or directory), regardless of whether
@@code{setup.exe} believes it is necessary.  You @@strong{must} omit '-u'
if you are updating from a development snapshot, because development
snapshots have their version numbers "bumped" to the next release
number.  In this case, @@code{setup.exe} will think your installation is
already up-to-date.

Once setup is complete you may remove the temporary directory.  It will
contain @@code{setup.exe}, the downloaded @@code{.tar.gz} files, and a
setup log file, which is not needed, but may contain helpful diagnostics
if your installation failed for some reason.

@@subsection Problems running @@code{setup.exe}

@@subsubsection Error message: "Unable to retrieve the list of cygwin mirrors..."

This means that @@code{setup.exe} could not make an http connection to
@@file{http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/mirrors.html}.  This is
required for an internet ('i') install.  Either sources.redhat.com was
too busy, or there is a problem with your network.  Note that
@@code{setup.exe} has very limited proxy functionality for firewalls, and
depends on IE4 or later being installed and configured properly.  If you
cannot get the internet installation to work, just download the
packages yourself and do a directory ('d') install.

@@subsubsection System hangs when unpacking tar archives

Your anti-virus software is interfering with @@code{setup.exe}.  You will
have to disable it before running setup.  In that case, you will
probably want to:
@@enumerate
@@item download all the .tar.gz files for the packages, along with @@code{setup.exe}

Development tools:
binutils, bison, byacc, dejagnu, diff, expect, flex, gas, gcc, gdb,
itcl, ld, libstdc++, make, patch, tcl, tix, tk

User tools:
ash, bash, bzip2, diff, fileutils, findutils, gawk, grep, gzip, m4,
sed, shellutils, tar, textutils, time

The user tools release only contains the user tools.

Full source code is available for these tools.  It is split into
these two units.

@@section Installing the binary release:

@@strong{(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)}

Important!  Be sure to remove any older versions of the Cygwin tools
from your PATH environment variable so you do not execute them by
mistake.

To download the cygwin files, you may use whatever ftp, browser, or
other transfer program you are familiar with.  To download multiple
files without interaction, you may wish to try the @@code{wget}
program.  Visit the cygwin home page's software listings to find a
pre-built copy of it.

Connect to one of the ftp servers listed above and cd to the directory
containing the latest release.  A list of mirror sites is at:

@@file{http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/mirrors.html}.

If you want the development tools and the programs necessary to run
the GNU configure mechanism, you should download the full binary release
called @@file{full.exe}.  If you only care about the user tools
listed above, download @@file{usertools.exe} instead.

If you have an unreliable connection, download the appropriate binary in
smaller chunks instead.  For the split cdk installer, get the files in
the @@file{full-split} subdirectory.  Once downloaded, combine the
split files at the command prompt by doing a:

@@smallexample
copy /b xaa + xab + xac + ... + xak + xal full.exe
del xa*.*
@@end smallexample

A similar process can be used for the user tools.

Once you have an install executable on your system, run it.  If
a previous version of the software is detected, it will offer to
uninstall it for you.

Next it will ask you to choose an install location.  The default is
@@file{<system-drive>:\cygnus\cygwin-b20}.  Feel free to choose another
location if you would prefer.

Finally, it will ask you for the name of the Program Files folder
shortcut to add.  By default, the installer will create
a @@file{Cygwin B20} entry in a
folder called @@file{Cygnus Solutions}.  When this step is completed, it
will install the tools and exit.

At this point, you should be able to look under the start menu and
select "Cygwin B20".  This will pop up a bash shell with all special
environment variables set up for you.  If you are running Windows 95 or
98 and are faced with the error message "Out of environment space", you
need to increase the amount of environment space in your config.sys and
try again.  Adding the line @@code{shell=C:\command.com /e:4096 /p}
should do the trick if @@code{C:} is your system drive letter.

There are two remaining thing you should do from this prompt.
First, you need to type @@code{mkdir -p /tmp} to ensure that a directory
for temporary files exists for programs that expect to find one there.

Second, if you are installing the full distribution
(@@file{full.exe}), various programs will need to be able to find
@@file{/bin/sh}.  You should @@file{mkdir -p /bin} and put a copy of
@@file{sh.exe} there, removing the older version, if present.  You can
use the @@file{mount} utility to select which drive letter is mounted as
@@file{/}. See the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file for more
information on @@file{mount}.

If you should ever want to uninstall the tools, you may do so
via the "Add/Remove Programs" control panel.

@@section Installing the source code

@@strong{(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.)}

Before downloading the source code corresponding to the release,
you should install the latest release of the tools (either the full
release or just the user tools).

Create the directory that will house the source code.  @@file{cd}
there.

Connect to one of the ftp servers listed above and cd to the directory
containing the latest release.  A list of mirror sites is at:

@@file{http://sourceware.cygnus.com/cygwin/mirrors.html}.

If you want the user tools source code, @@file{cd} into the
@@file{user-src-split} subdirectory.  Download the files there.  If you
want the development tools sources, @@file{cd} into the
@@file{dev-src-split} subdirectory.  Download the files there.

Back in the Windows command shell, for the user tools source:

@@smallexample
copy /b xba + xbb + xbc + xbd + xbe + xbf + xbg user-src.tar.bz2
del xb*.*
bunzip2 user-src.tar.bz2
tar xvf user-src.tar
@@end smallexample

For the development tools source:

@@smallexample
copy /b xca + xcb + xcc + xcd + ... + xck + xcl dev-src.tar.bz2
del xc*.*
bunzip2 dev-src.tar.bz2
tar xvf dev-src.tar
@@end smallexample

Both expand into a directory called @@file{src}.

Note: if you want the sources corresponding to everything in the
full.exe binary installer, you will need to download and expand both
the user-src.tar.bz2 and dev-src.tar.bz2 source archives!

And you should be done...

@@section Upgrading to B20.1

@@strong{(Please note: This section has not yet been updated for the latest
net release.  Even the section's title is wrong!)}

If you downloaded the original B20.0 release, you should definitely at
least upgrade the Cygwin library to the version present in B20.1.  To do
this, download the file
@@file{cygwin-b20/cygwin1-20.1.dll.bz2} from one of our mirror sites,
decompress it with bunzip2, and then install the dll, replacing
the file cygwin-b20/H-i586-cygwin32/bin/cygwin1.dll in your original
installation of 20.0.

There are some additional patches in a few of the other tools
(including a gcc change that makes -mno-cygwin find the correct header
files).  In addition, the tools have been built with a compiled-in path
of /cygnus/cygwin-b20/ which will make some tools such as bison find
their library files without help from environment variables.
To install the full 20.1 release, you will need to download the
correct installer from scratch.  It will offer to uninstall the existing
release and replace it with 20.1 (You should choose to uninstall b20 and
proceed).

We have diff files on the ftp site that can be used to upgrade the
original B20.0 sources.  20.0-20.1-dev-src.diff.bz2 upgrades the
development tools sources.  20.0-20.1-user-src.diff.bz2 upgrades the
user tools sources.  They come compressed so you'll need to bunzip2 them
before proceeding.  As an example, if the development tools are in the
directory called "src" and the patch is in the directory above it, apply
the patch as follows:

@@smallexample
cd src
patch -p1 -E < ../20.0-20.1-dev-src.diff
