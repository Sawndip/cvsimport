<question><para>What is the recommended installation procedure?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>There is only one recommended way to install Cygwin, which is to use the GUI
installer <command>setup-*.exe</command>.  It is flexible and easy to use.  
You can pick and choose the packages you wish to install, and update
them individually.  Full source code is available for all packages and
tools.  More information on using Cygwin Setup may be found at
<ulink url="https://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-net.html"/>.
</para>
<para>If you do it any other way, you're on your own!
If something doesn't work right for you, and
it's not covered here or in the latest development snapshot at
<ulink url="https://cygwin.com/snapshots/"/>, then by all means report it to the
mailing list.

<qandaentry id="faq.setup.automated">
<question><para>What about an automated Cygwin installation?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>The Cygwin Setup program is designed to be interactive, but there are
a few different ways to automate it. If you are deploying to multiple systems,
the best way is to run through a full installation once, saving the entire 
downloaded package tree. Then, on target systems, run Cygwin Setup as a
"Local Install" pointed at your downloaded package tree. You could do this 
non-interactively with the command line options
<literal>-q -L -l x:\cygwin-local\</literal>, where your downloaded 
package tree is in <literal>x:\cygwin-local\</literal> (see the next FAQ for
an explanation of those options.)
</para>

<qandaentry id="faq.setup.noroot">
<question><para>Can I install Cygwin without administrator rights?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Yes.  The default installation requests administrator rights because
this allows to set up the Cygwin environment so that all users can start
a Cygwin shell out of the box.  However, if you don't have administrator
rights for your machine, and the admins don't want to install it for you,
you can install Cygwin just for yourself by downloading
<command>setup-x86.exe</command> (for a 32 bit install) or
<command>setup-x86_64.exe</command> (for a 64 bit install) and then start
it from the command line or via the "Run..." dialog from the start menu
using the <literal>--no-admin</literal> option, for instance:</para>

<para>
<screen>
  setup-x86.exe --no-admin
</screen>
</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry id="faq.setup.c">
<question><para>Why not install in C:\?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>The Cygwin Setup program will prompt you for a "root" directory.
The default is <literal>C:\cygwin</literal>, but you can change it.  You are urged not to
choose something like <literal>C:\</literal> (the root directory on the system drive) for
your Cygwin root.  If you do, then critical Cygwin system directories
like <literal>etc</literal>, <literal>lib</literal> and <literal>bin</literal> could easily be corrupted by
other (non-Cygwin) applications or packages that use <literal>\etc</literal>,
<literal>\lib</literal> or <literal>\bin</literal>.  Perhaps there is no conflict now, but who
knows what you might install in the future?  It's also just good common
sense to segregate your Cygwin "filesystems" from the rest of your
Windows system disk.
</para>
<para>(In the past, there had been genuine bugs that would cause problems
for people who installed in <literal>C:\</literal>, but we believe those are gone
now.)
</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry id="faq.setup.old-versions">
<question><para>Can I use Cygwin Setup to get old versions of packages (like gcc-2.95)?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Cygwin Setup can be used to install any packages that are on a
Cygwin mirror, which usually includes one version previous to the
current one. The complete list may be searched at 
<ulink url="https://cygwin.com/packages/"/>.  There is no complete archive of
older packages. If you have a problem with the current version of
a Cygwin package, please report it to the mailing list using the 
guidelines at <ulink url="https://cygwin.com/problems.html"/>.
</para>
<para>That said, if you really need an older package, you may be able to find
an outdated or archival mirror by searching the web for an old package
version (for example, <literal>gcc2-2.95.3-10-src.tar.bz2</literal>), but keep in
mind that this older version will not be supported by the mailing list
and that installing the older version will not help improve Cygwin.
</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry id="faq.setup.virus">
<question><para>Is Cygwin Setup, or one of the packages, infected with a virus?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Unlikely.  Unless you can confirm it, please don't report it to the
mailing list.  Anti-virus products have been known to detect false
positives when extracting compressed tar archives.  If this causes
problems for you, consider disabling your anti-virus software when
running <literal>setup</literal>.  Read the next entry for a fairly safe way to do
this.
</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry id="faq.setup.hang">
<question><para>My computer hangs when I run Cygwin Setup!</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Both Network Associates (formerly McAfee) and Norton anti-virus
products have been reported to "hang" when extracting Cygwin tar
archives.  If this happens to you, consider disabling your anti-virus
software when running Cygwin Setup.  The following procedure should be
a fairly safe way to do that:
</para>
<orderedlist><listitem><para>Download <literal>setup-x86.exe</literal> or
<literal>setup-x86_64.exe</literal> and scan it explicitly.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Turn off the anti-virus software.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Run setup to download and extract all the tar files.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Re-activate your anti-virus software and scan everything
in C:\cygwin (or wherever you chose to install), or your entire hard
disk if you are paranoid.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>This should be safe, but only if Cygwin Setup is not substituted by
something malicious, and no mirror has been compromised.
</para>
<para>See also <ulink url="https://cygwin.com/faq/faq.html#faq.using.bloda"/>
for a list of applications that have been known, at one time or another, to
interfere with the normal functioning of Cygwin.
</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry id="faq.setup.what-packages">
<question><para>What packages should I download? Where are 'make', 'gcc', 'vi', etc?  </para></question>
<answer>
<para>When using Cygwin Setup for the first time, the default is to install
a minimal subset of all available packages.  If you want anything beyond that,
you will have to select it explicitly.  See 
<ulink url="https://cygwin.com/packages/"/> for a searchable list of available
packages, or use <literal>cygcheck -p </literal> as described in the Cygwin
User's Guide at
<ulink url="https://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/using-utils.html#cygcheck"/>.
</para>
<para>If you want to build programs, of course you'll need <literal>gcc</literal>,
<literal>binutils</literal>, <literal>make</literal> and probably other packages from the
``Devel'' category. Text editors can be found under ``Editors''.
</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry id="faq.setup.everything">
<question><para>How do I just get everything?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Long ago, the default was to install everything, much to the
irritation of most users.  Now the default is to install only a basic
core of packages.  Cygwin Setup is designed to make it easy to browse
categories and select what you want to install or omit from those
categories.  It's also easy to install everything:
</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>At the ``Select Packages'' screen, in ``Categories'' view, at the line 
marked ``All'', click on the word ``default'' so that it changes to
``install''.  (Be patient, there is some computing to do at this step.
It may take a second or two to register the change.)  This tells Setup
to install <emphasis>everything</emphasis>, not just what it thinks you should have
by default.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Now click on the ``View'' button (twice) until you get to the
``Pending'' view.  This shows exactly which packages are about to be
downloaded and installed.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>This procedure only works for packages that are currently available.
There is no way to tell Cygwin Setup to install all packages by
default from now on.  As new packages become available that would not
be installed by default, you have to repeat the above procedure to get
them.
</para>
<para>In general, a better method (in my opinion), is to:
</para>
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>First download &amp; install all packages that would normally be
installed by default.  This includes fundamental packages and any
updates to what you have already installed.  Then...
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>Run Cygwin Setup again, and apply the above technique to get all
new packages that would not be installed by default.  You can check
the list in the ``Pending'' view before proceeding, in case there's
something you really <emphasis>don't</emphasis> want.
</para>
</listitem>
<listitem><para>In the latest version of Cygwin Setup, if you click the ``View''
button (twice) more, it shows packages not currently installed.  You
ought to check whether you <emphasis>really</emphasis> want to install everything!
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry id="faq.setup.disk-space">
<question><para>How much disk space does Cygwin require?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>That depends, obviously, on what you've chosen to download and
install.  A full installation today is probably larger than 1 GB
installed, not including the package archives themselves nor the source
code.
</para>
<para>After installation, the package archives remain in your ``Local
Package Directory''.  By default the location of
<literal>setup-x86{_64}.exe</literal>.  You may conserve disk space by
deleting the subdirectories there.  These directories will have very weird
looking names, being encoded with their URLs
(named <literal>ftp%3a%2f...</literal>).
</para>
<para>Of course, you can keep them around in case you want to reinstall a
package. If you want to clean out only the outdated packages, Michael Chase
has written a script called <literal>clean_setup.pl</literal>, available
at <ulink url="ftp://cygwin.com/pub/cygwin/unsupported/clean_setup.pl" />.
</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry id="faq.setup.what-upgraded">
<question><para>How do I know which version I upgraded from?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Detailed logs of the most recent Cygwin Setup session can be found in
<literal>/var/log/setup.log.full</literal> and less verbose information about
prior actions is in <literal>/var/log/setup.log</literal>.
</para>

</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry id="faq.setup.setup-fails">
<question><para>What if setup fails?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>First, make sure that you are using the latest version of Cygwin Setup.
The latest version is always available from the Cygwin Home Page at
<ulink url="https://cygwin.com/"/>.
</para>
<para>If you are downloading from the Internet, setup will fail if it cannot
download the list of mirrors at <ulink url="https://cygwin.com/mirrors.html"/>.
It could be that the network is too busy.  Something similar could be the
cause of a download site not working.  Try another mirror, or try again
later.
</para>
<para>If setup refuses to download a package that you know needs to be
upgraded, try deleting that package's entry from /etc/setup.  If you are
reacting quickly to an announcement on the mailing list, it could be
that the mirror you are using doesn't have the latest copy yet.  Try
another mirror, or try again tomorrow.
</para>
<para>If setup has otherwise behaved strangely, check the files
<literal>setup.log</literal> and <literal>setup.log.full</literal> in
<literal>/var/log</literal> (<literal>C:\cygwin\var\log</literal> by
default).  It may provide some clues as to what went wrong and why.
</para>
<para>If you're still baffled, search the Cygwin mailing list for clues.
Others may have the same problem, and a solution may be posted there.
If that search proves fruitless, send a query to the Cygwin mailing
list.  You must provide complete details in your query: version of
setup, options you selected, contents of setup.log and setup.log.full,
what happened that wasn't supposed to happen, etc.

<question><para>My Windows logon name has a space in it, will this cause problems?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Most definitely yes!  UNIX shells (and thus Cygwin) use the space
character as a word delimiter.  Under certain circumstances, it is
possible to get around this with various shell quoting mechanisms, but
you are much better off if you can avoid the problem entirely.

you will need to boot into Safe Mode to access the Security tab.  Select 
Advanced, then go to the Owner tab and make sure your account is listed as 
the owner.  Select the 'Replace owner on subcontainers and objects' checkbox

<qandaentry id="faq.setup.snapshots">
<question><para>How do I install snapshots?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>First, are you sure you want to do this?  Snapshots are risky.  They
have not been tested.  Use them <emphasis role='bold'>only</emphasis> if there is a feature or
bugfix that you need to try, and you are willing to deal with any
problems, or at the request of a Cygwin developer.
</para>
<para>You cannot use Cygwin Setup to install a snapshot.
</para>
<para>First, you will need to download the snapshot from the snapshots
page at <ulink url="https://cygwin.com/snapshots/"/>.  Note the directory where
you saved the snapshot tarball.
</para>
<para>Before installing a snapshot, you must first Close <emphasis role='bold'>all</emphasis> Cygwin
applications, including shells and services (e.g., <literal>inetd</literal>, <literal>sshd</literal>).
You will not be able to replace <literal>cygwin1.dll</literal> if any Cygwin process is
running.  You may have to restart Windows to clear the DLL from memory
(beware of automatic service startup).
</para>
<para>Most of the downloaded snapshot can be installed using <literal>tar</literal>.  Cygwin
<literal>tar</literal> won't be able to update <literal>/usr/bin/cygwin1.dll</literal> (because it's
used by <literal>tar</literal> itself), but it should succeed with everything else.  If
you are only installing the DLL snapshot, skip the first tar command.  Open
a <literal>bash</literal> shell (it should be the only running Cygwin process) and issue
the following commands:
<screen>
	/bin/tar -C / -xvf /posix/path/to/cygwin-inst-YYYYMMDD.tar.* --exclude=usr/bin/cygwin1.dll
	/bin/tar -C /tmp -xvf /posix/path/to/cygwin-inst-YYYYMMDD.tar.* usr/bin/cygwin1.dll
</screen>
</para>
<para>Exit the bash shell, and use Explorer or the Windows command shell to
first rename <literal>C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll</literal> to
<literal>C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1-prev.dll</literal> and then move
<literal>C:\cygwin\tmp\usr\bin\cygwin1.dll</literal>
to <literal>C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll</literal> (assuming you installed Cygwin in
<literal>C:\cygwin</literal>).
</para>
<para>The operative word in trying the snapshots is "<emphasis>trying</emphasis>".  If you
notice a problem with the snapshot that was not present in the release
DLL (what we call a "regression"), please report it to the Cygwin
mailing list (see <ulink url="https://cygwin.com/problems.html"/> for problem
reporting guidelines).  If you wish to go back to the older version of the
DLL, again, close all Cygwin processes, delete
<literal>C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll</literal>, and
rename <literal>C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1-prev.dll</literal> back to
<literal>C:\cygwin\bin\cygwin1.dll</literal> (again assuming that your "<literal>/</literal>" is
<literal>C:\cygwin</literal>).  To restore the rest of the snapshot
files, reinstall the "<literal>cygwin</literal>" package using Setup.

<question><para>After upgrading from Cygwin 1.5 to Cygwin 1.7 my user mount points disappeared!  How can I get them back?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>
When you upgrade an existing older Cygwin installation to Cygwin 1.7, your old
system mount points (stored in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE branch of your registry)
are read by a script and the /etc/fstab file is generated from these entries. 
No such automatism exists for the user mount points formerly stored in the
HKEY_CURRENT_USER branch of the registry.  There's a bash script for your
convenience, which creates a user-specific /etc/fstab/${USER} file for you,
called /bin/copy-user-registry-fstab.  For more information on the new fstab
files see the User's Guide at

<qandaentry id="faq.setup.setup-fails-on-ts">
<question><para>My installation on a Terminal Server machine goes wrong.  What can I do?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>The problem is that Terminal Server machines do some compatibility
checks when running applications which are not marked as
"Terminal Server-aware", and this compatibility check seems to be buggy,
leaving parts of the application in a non-executable state.  Curious enough,
this only happens if DEP (Data Execution Prevention) is turned on for
all applications.</para>

<para>So far, only few Cygwin packages have their binaries marked as
TS-aware, which means there's a good chance that the postinstall scripts
during the installation will break, and that after installation you
can't start a shell, etc.</para>

<para>So, for the time being, here's how you install Cygwin on a Terminal
Server.  First, switch DEP to "Turn on DEP for essential Windows programs
and services only" and reboot the machine.  Then install via setup.exe.
You can leave it at that and run the Terminal Server in the aforementioned
DEP setting.  Or use the peflags tool from the rebase package to set
the TS-aware flag in all executables, switch DEP back to "Turn on DEP for

we have plans for replacing it, too.)  See ChangeLog for details.
