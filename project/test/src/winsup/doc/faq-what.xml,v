<title>About Cygwin</title>

<!-- faq-what.xml -->
<qandaentry id="faq.what.what">
<question><para>What is it?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Cygwin is a distribution of popular GNU and other Open Source tools
running on Microsoft Windows.  The core part is the Cygwin library which
provides the POSIX system calls and environment these programs expect.
</para>
<para>The Cygwin distribution contains thousands of packages from the Open
Source world including most GNU tools, many BSD tools, an X server and a full
set of X applications.  If you're a developer you will find tools, headers
and libraries allowing to write Windows console or GUI applications that make
use of significant parts of the POSIX API.  Cygwin allows easy porting of many
Unix programs without the need for extensive changes to the source code.  This
includes configuring and building most of the available GNU or BSD software,
including the packages included with the Cygwin distribution themselves.
They can be used from one of the provided Unix shells like bash, tcsh or zsh.
</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry id="faq.what.supported">
<question><para>What versions of Windows are supported?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Cygwin can be expected to run on all modern, released versions of Windows.
State January 2015 this includes Windows XP SP3, Windows Server 2003/2003R2
and all later versions of Windows up to Windows 8.1 and Windows Server 2012R2.
The 32 bit version of Cygwin also runs in the WOW64 32 bit environment on
released 64 bit versions of Windows (XP SP3 up to 8.1/2012R2), the 64 bit
version of course only on 64 bit Windows.
</para>
<para>Keep in mind that Cygwin can only do as much as the underlying OS
supports.  Because of this, Cygwin will behave differently, and
exhibit different limitations, on the various versions of Windows.
</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry id="faq.what.where">
<question><para>Where can I get it?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>The home page for the Cygwin project is
<ulink url="https://cygwin.com/"/>.
There you should find everything you need for Cygwin, including links
for download and setup, a current list of mirror sites, a User's
Guide, an API Reference, mailing lists and archives.
</para>
<para>You can find documentation for the individual GNU tools typically
as man pages or info pages as part of the Cygwin net distribution.
Additionally you can get the latest docs at
<ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/manual/"/>.  (You should read GNU manuals from a
local mirror.  Check <ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/server/list-mirrors.html"/>
for a list of them.)
</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry id="faq.what.free">
<question><para>Is it free software?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>Yes.  Parts are GNU software (gcc, gas, ld, etc...), parts are covered
by the standard X11 license, some of it is public domain, some of
it was written by Red Hat (or the former Cygnus Solutions) and placed under
the GPL.  None of it is shareware.  You don't have to pay anyone to use it
but you should be sure to read the copyright section of the FAQ for more
information on how the GNU General Public License may affect your use of
these tools.
</para>
<para>In particular, if you intend to port a proprietary (non-GPL'd)
application using Cygwin, you will need the proprietary-use license 
for the Cygwin library.  This is available for purchase from Red Hat;
please visit <ulink url="https://cygwin.com/licensing.html"/> for more
information.  All other questions should be sent to the public project
mailing list cygwin@@cygwin.com.
</para>
<para>Note that when we say "free" we mean freedom, not price.  The goal of
such freedom is that the people who use a given piece of software
should be able to change it to fit their needs, learn from it, share
it with their friends, etc.  The Cygwin license allows you those
freedoms, so it is free software.
</para>
</answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry id="faq.what.version">
<question><para>What version of Cygwin <emphasis>is</emphasis> this, anyway?</para></question>
<answer>

<para>To find the version of the Cygwin DLL installed, you can use
<filename>uname</filename> as on Linux or <filename>cygcheck</filename>. Refer to each command's
<literal>--help</literal> output and the
<ulink url='https://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/'>Cygwin User's Guide</ulink>
for more information.
</para>
<para>If you are looking for the version number for the whole Cygwin
release, there is none. Each package in the Cygwin release has its own
version.  The packages in Cygwin are continually improving, thanks to
the efforts of net volunteers who maintain the Cygwin binary ports.
Each package has its own version numbers and its own release process.
</para>
<para>So, how do you get the most up-to-date version of Cygwin?  Easy.  Just
download the Cygwin Setup program by following the instructions
<ulink url='https://cygwin.com/install.html'>here</ulink>.
The setup program will handle the task of updating the packages on your system
to the latest version. For more information about using Cygwin's
<filename>setup.exe</filename>, see 
<ulink url='https://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/setup-net.html'>Setting Up Cygwin</ulink>
in the Cygwin User's Guide. 
</para></answer></qandaentry>

<qandaentry id="faq.what.who">
<question><para>Who's behind the project?</para></question>
<answer>

<para><emphasis role='bold'>(Please note that if you have cygwin-specific
questions, all of these people will appreciate it if you use the cygwin
mailing lists rather than sending personal email.)</emphasis>
</para>
<para>
Corinna Vinschen is the current project lead. Corinna is a senior Red Hat
engineer. Corinna is responsible for the Cygwin library and maintains a couple
of packages, for instance OpenSSH, OpenSSL, and a lot more.
</para>
<para>
Yaakov Selkowitz is another Red Hat engineer working on the Cygwin project.
He's the guy behind the current build and packaging system and maintains by
far the most packages in the Cygwin distribution.
</para>
<para>
Jon Turney is developer and maintainer of the Cygwin X server and a couple
of related packages.
</para>
<para>
The packages in the Net release are maintained by a large group of people;
a complete list can be found
<ulink url='https://cygwin.com/cygwin-pkg-maint'>here</ulink>.
</para>
<para>Please note that all of us working on Cygwin try to be as responsive as
possible and deal with patches and questions as we get them, but realistically
we don't have time to answer all of the email that is sent to the main mailing
list.  Making Net releases of the Win32 tools and helping people on the Net out
is not our primary job function, so some email will have to go unanswered.
</para>
<para>Many thanks to everyone using the tools for their many contributions in
the form of advice, bug reports, and code fixes.  Keep them coming!

<para>Steve Chamberlain designed and implemented
Cygwin in 1995-1996 while working for Cygnus.  He worked with the Net
to improve the technology, ported/integrated many of the user tools
for the first time to Cygwin, and produced all of the releases up to
beta 14.  Steve is not currently employed by Red Hat.
</para>
<para>Sergey Okhapkin has been an invaluable Net contributor.  He implemented
the tty/pty support, has played a significant role in revamping signal
and exception handling, and has made countless contributions throughout
the library.  He also provided binaries of the development snapshots to
the Net after the beta 19 release.

<para>Philippe Giacinti contributed the implementation of dlopen, dlclose,
dlsym, dlfork, and dlerror in Cygwin.
</para>
<para>Ian Lance Taylor did a much-needed rework of the path handling code for
beta 18, and has made many assorted fixes throughout the code.  Jeremy
Allison made significant contributions in the area of file handling and
process control, and rewrote select from scratch.  Doug Evans rewrote
the path-handling code in beta 16, among other things.  Kim Knuttila and
Michael Meissner put in many long hours working on the now-defunct
PowerPC port.  Jason Molenda and Mark Eichin have also made important
contributions.

<para>Chris Faylor is behind many of the recent changes in Cygwin.  Prior to
joining Cygnus, he contributed significant fixes to the process control
and environ code, reworked the strace mechanism, and rewrote the
signal-related code from scratch as a Net contributor.  In addition to
continuing to make technical contributions, Chris is also currently the
group's manager.

authored the cygcheck utility, and made automated snapshots available
from our project WWW page.  DJ is currently employed by Red Hat as
a GCC engineer.

<para>Egor Duda has contributed many useful fixes.  He is responsible for
Cygwin's ability to start a debugger on detection of a fatal error
as well as produce core dumps.
