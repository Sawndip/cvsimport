@Cygwin is free software.  Red Hat, Inc. licenses Cygwin to you under the
terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software
Foundation; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of
the GNU General Public License either version 3 of the license, or (at your
option) any later version (GPLv3+), along with the additional permissions
given below.

There is NO WARRANTY for this software, express or implied, including
the implied warranties of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
with this program.  If not, see <http://gnu.org/licenses/>.


Additional Permissions:


1. Linking Exception.

As a special exception to GPLv3+, Red Hat grants you permission to link
software whose sources are distributed under a license that satisfies
the Open Source Definition with libcygwin.a, without libcygwin.a
itself causing the resulting program to be covered by GPLv3+.

This means that you can port an Open Source application to Cygwin, and
distribute that executable as if it didn't include a copy of
libcygwin.a linked into it.  Note that this does not apply to the
Cygwin DLL itself.  If you distribute a (possibly modified) version of
the Cygwin DLL, you must adhere to the terms of GPLv3+, including the
requirement to provide sources for the Cygwin DLL, unless you have obtained
a special Cygwin license to distribute the Cygwin DLL in only its binary
form (see below).

See http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd/ for the precise Open Source
Definition referenced above.


2.  Files Excluded from GPL Coverage.

Red Hat grants you permission to distribute Cygwin with the following
files, which are not considered part of Cygwin and are not governed by
GPLv3+, in source or binary form.

winsup\testsuite\winsup.api\msgtest.c
winsup\testsuite\winsup.api\semtest.c
winsup\testsuite\winsup.api\shmtest.c

Red Hat grants you permission to link or combine code in Cygwin with
code in or corresponding to the following files, which are not
considered part of Cygwin and are not governed by GPLv3+, and to
distribute such combinations under terms of your choice, provided that
such terms are otherwise consistent with the application of GPLv3+ to
Cygwin itself.  You must comply with GPLv3+ with respect to all
portions of such combinations other than those that correspond to or
are derived from such non-Cygwin code but which do not correspond to
or are not derived from Cygwin itself.

winsup\cygserver\sysv_shm.cc


3.  Alternative License. 

Red Hat sells a special Cygwin License for customers who are unable to
provide their application in open source code form.  For more
information, please see: http://www.redhat.com/software/cygwin/, or call
+1-866-2REDHAT ext. 45300 (toll-free in the US).

Outside the US call your regional Red Hat office, see
