 *
 * A trivial stub, to replace the _get_output_format() function.
 *
 * _pformat() requires this function, which is provided by MSVCRT runtimes
 * from msvcr80.dll onwards; add this stub to the import libraries for earlier
 * versions of MSVCRT, (those which do not already advertise availability of
 * any exported _get_output_format() function); this will permit _pformat()
 * to transparently interoperate with all supported versions of MSVCRT.
 * (Likewise for CRTDLL).

 * that entire API is unsupported, so no such prior call is possible).
