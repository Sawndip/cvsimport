        * include/io.h (__finddata64_t, __wfinddata64_t): changed member 'size'
        from '_fsize_t' to '__int64' to be consistent with the other ...64
        structures and the value set there is 8 bytes not 4.  Add guard for both
        as the are only used by functions available from 6.1 on.

        * include/wchar.h (__wfinddata64_t): changed member 'size' from '_fsize_t'
        to '__int64' to be consistent with the other ...64 structures and the value
        set there is 8 bytes not 4.  Added guard as this function is only used by
        functions available from 6.1 on.

        * include/sys/stat.h: some members of 'stat' were declared with types with
        a prefixed underscore, while the ones without the underscore should have
        been used.  Added guard to '__stat64' as it is only used by functions
        available from 6.1 on.  Added the wide character versions of the
        exec()/spawn() family for completion
        (_stati64): changed the type of the 'st_mode' member from 'unsigned int' to
        '_mode_t'

        * include/sys/timeb.h (timeb, _timb): changed the type of the 'time' member
        from 'long' to 'time_t'
        (__timeb64): moved declaration of structure directly before the declaration
        of the function '_ftime64()', so it is guarded as well

        * include/sys/utime.h (__utimbuf64): moved declaration of structure directly
        before the declaration of the functions using it, so it is guarded as well
