			*** NOTE ***

In accordance with section 10 of the GPL, Red Hat permits programs whose
sources are distributed under a license that complies with the Open
Source definition to be linked with libcygwin.a without libcygwin.a
itself causing the resulting program to be covered by the GNU GPL.

This means that you can port an Open Source(tm) application to cygwin,
and distribute that executable as if it didn't include a copy of
libcygwin.a linked into it.  Note that this does not apply to the cygwin
DLL itself.  If you distribute a (possibly modified) version of the DLL
you must adhere to the terms of the GPL, i.e. you must provide sources
for the cygwin DLL.

See http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition_plain.html for the precise Open Source
Definition referenced above.

Red Hat sells a special Cygwin License for customers who are unable to
provide their application in open source code form.  For more
information, please see: http://www.redhat.com/software/tools/cygwin/,
or call 866-2REDHAT ext.  3007
