    <title>Abstract</title>

    <para>This document attempts to describe the functionality of
    DejaGnu, the GNU Testing Framework. DejaGnu is entirely written in
    <productname>Expect</productname>, which uses
    <productname>Tcl</productname> as a command
    language. <productname>Expect</productname> serves as a very
    programmable shell; you can run any program, as with the usual
    Unix command shells---but once the program is started, your
    test script has fully programmable control of
    its input and output.  This does not just apply to the programs
    under test; <command>expect</command> can also run any auxiliary
    program, such as <command>diff</command> or <command>sh</command>,
    with full control over its input and output.</para>  

    <para>DejaGnu itself is merely a framework for creation of a test
    suites. Test suites are distributed separately for each GNU
    tool.</para>

    <sect1 id=whatis xreflabel="What is &dj; ?">
      <title>What is &dj; ?</title>

    <para><productname>DejaGnu</productname> is a framework for
	testing other programs.  Its purpose is to provide a single
	front end for all tests. Think of it as a custom library of
	Tcl procedures crafted to support writing a test harness. A
	<emphasis>Test Harness</emphasis> is the testing
	infrastructure that is created to support a specific program
	or tool. Each program can have multiple test suites, all
	supported by a single test harness. DejaGnu is written in
	<productname>Expect</productname>, which in turn uses
	<productname>Tcl</productname> -- Tool command
	language. There is more information on Tcl at the <ulink
	URL="http://www.scriptics.com">Scriptics</ulink> web site, and the
	Expect web site is at <ulink
	URL="http://expect.nist.gov">NIST</ulink>.</para>

	<para>DejaGnu offers several advantages for testing:</para>

    <itemizedlist mark="bullet" spacing="compact">

      <listitem><para>The flexibility and consistency of the DejaGnu
	framework make it easy to write tests for any program, with
	either batch oriented, or interactive programs.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>DejaGnu provides a layer of abstraction which
	allows you to write tests that are portable to any host or
	target where a program must be tested. For instance, a test
	for <command>GDB</command> can run (from any Unix
	based host) on any target architecture that DejaGnu
	supports. Currently DejaGnu runs tests on many single board
	computers, whose operating software ranges from just a boot
	monitor to a full-fledged, Unix-like realtime OS.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>All tests have the same output format. This
	makes it easy to integrate testing into other software
	development processes. DejaGnu's output is designed to be
	parsed by other filtering script, and it is also human
	readable.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem><para>Using Tcl and expect, it's easy to create wrappers
      for existing test suites. By incorporating existing tests under
      DejaGnu, it's easier to have a single set of report analyse
      programs..</para>

      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Running tests requires two things: the testing framework, and
    the test suites themselves. Tests are usually written in
    <productname>Expect</productname> using Tcl, but you can also use a
    Tcl script to run a test suite that is not based on
    <productname>Expect</productname>.
    (<productname>expect</productname> script filenames conventionally
    use <emphasis>.exp</emphasis> as a suffix; for example, the main
    implementation of the DejaGnu test driver is in the file
    <productname>runtest.exp</productname>.)</para>
	
    <para>Julia Menapace first coined the term ``Deja Gnu'' to describe an
    earlier testing framework at Cygnus Support she had written for
    <command>GDB</command>. When we replaced it with the Expect-based
    framework, it was like DejaGnu all over again... But more importantly, it
    was also named after my daughter,<ulink
    URL="mailto:deja@@welcomehome.org">Deja Snow Savoye</ulink> (now 9
    years old in Dec of 1998), who was a toddler during DejaGnu's
    creation.</para>

  <sect1 id=new xreflabel="Release Notes">
    <title>What's New In This Release</title>
  
    <para>This release has a number of substantial changes over version
    1.3. The most visible change is that the version of Expect and Tcl
    included in the release are up-to-date with the current stable net
    releases. The biggest change is years of modifications to the
    target configuration system, used for cross testing. While this
    greatly improved cross testing, is has made that subsystem very
    complicated. The goal is to have this entirely rewritten using
    <productname>iTcl</productname> by the next release. Other changes
    are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para>More builtin support for building target binaries
        with the correct linker flags. Currently this only works with
        <productname>GCC</productname> as the cross compiler,
	preferably with a target supported by
	<xref linkend=libgloss>.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Lots of little bug fixes from years of heavy
        use at Cygnus Solutions.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>DejaGnu now uses
      <productname>Automake</productname> for Makefile
      configuration.</para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Updated documentation, now in SGML
	(using the <ulink
	URL="http://nis-www.lanl.gov/~rosalia/mydocs/docbook-intro.html">free
	GNU DocBook tools</ulink>) format.</para></listitem>
	
      <listitem><para>NT support. There is beta level support for NT
      that is still a work in progress. This requires the <ulink
      URL="http://sources.redhat.com">Cygwin</ulink> POSIX system
      for NT.</para></listitem>

    </itemizedlist>

    <sect2 id=cygwin xreflabel="NT Support">
      <title>NT Support</title>
  
      <para>To use DejaGnu on NT, you need to first install the
	<ulink URL="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin">Cygwin</ulink>
	release. This works as of the B20.1 release. Cygwin is a POSIX
	system for NT. This covers both utility programs, and a libray
	that adds POSIX system calls to NT. Among them is pseudo tty
	support for NT that emulates the POSIX pty standard. The
	latest Cygwin is always available from <ulink
	URL="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin">this location</ulink>. This
	works well enough to run <emphasis>"make check"</emphasis> of
	the GNU development tree on NT after a native build. But the
	nature of pty's on NT is still evolving. Your mileage may
	vary...</para>

    </sect2>
	
  </sect1>

  <sect1 id=designgoals xreflabel="Design Goals">
    <title>Design Goals</title>

    <para>DejaGnu grew out of the internal needs of Cygnus Solutions. (then
    Cygnus Support). Cygnus maintained and enhanced a variety of free
    programs in many different environments, and we needed a testing
    tool that:</para>

    <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
      <listitem><para>was useful to developers while fixing
      bugs.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>automated running many tests during a software
      release process.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>was portable among a variety of host
      computers.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>supported cross-development
      testing.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>permitted testing interactive programs, like
      <command>GDB</command>; and </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>permitted testing batch oriented programs, like
      <command>GCC</command>.</para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Some of the requirements proved challenging.  For example,
    interactive programs do not lend themselves very well to automated testing.
    But all the requirements are important: for instance, it is imperative to
    make sure that <command>GDB</command> works as well when cross-debugging
    as it does in a native configuration. </para>

    <para>Probably the greatest challenge was testing in a cross-development
    environment (which can be a real nightmare).  Most cross-development
    environments are customized by each developer.  Even when buying packaged
    boards from vendors there are many differences.  The communication
    interfaces vary from a serial line to ethernet.  DejaGnu was designed with
    a modular communication setup, so that each kind of communication can be
    added as required, and supported thereafter.  Once a communication
    procedure is coded, any test can use it.  Currently DejaGnu can use
    <command>rsh</command>, <command>rlogin</command>,
    <command>telnet</command>, <command>tip</command>, 
    <command>kermit</command>, and <command>mondfe</command> for remote 
    communications.</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1 id=posix xreflabel="A POSIX Conforming Test Framework">
      <title>A POSIX conforming test framework</title>

      <para>DejaGnu conforms to the POSIX 1003.3 standard for test
      frameworks. I was also a member of that committe.</para>

      <para>The POSIX standard 1003.3 defines what a testing framework needs to
      provide, in order to permit the creation of POSIX conformance test
      suites. This standard is primarily oriented to running POSIX conformance
      tests, but its requirements also support testing of features not related
      to POSIX conformance.  POSIX 1003.3 does not specify a particular testing
      framework, but at this time there is only one other POSIX conforming test
      framework: TET. TET was created by Unisoft for a consortium comprised of
      X/Open, Unix International, and the Open Software Foundation.</para>

      <para>The POSIX documentation refers to <firstterm>assertions</firstterm>.
      An assertion is a description of behavior.  For example, if a standard
      says ``The sun shall shine'', a corresponding assertion might be ``The
      sun is shining.''  A test based on this assertion would pass or fail
      depending on whether it is daytime or nighttime.  It is important to note
      that the standard being tested is never 1003.3; the standard being tested
      is some other standard, for which the assertions were written.</para>

      <para>As there is no test suite to test testing frameworks for POSIX
      1003.3 conformance, verifying conformance to this standard is done by
      repeatedly reading the standard and experimenting.  One of the main
      things 1003.3 does specify is the set of allowed output messages, and
      their definitions.  Four messages are supported for a required feature of
      POSIX conforming systems, and a fifth for a conditional feature. DejaGnu
      supports the use of all five output messages; in this sense a test suite
      that uses exactly these messages can be considered POSIX conforming.
      These definitions specify the output of a test
      case:</para>

      <variablelist> 
	<varlistentry>
	  <term>PASS</term>
	  <listitem><para>A test has succeeded.  That is, it demonstrated that
	  the assertion is true.</para></listitem>
	</varlistentry>
 
        <varlistentry>
	  <term>XFAIL</term>
	  <listitem><para>POSIX 1003.3 does not incorporate the notion of
	  expected failures, so <emphasis>PASS</emphasis>, instead of
	  <emphasis>XPASS</emphasis>, must also be returned for test cases
	  which were expected to fail and did not.  This means that
	  <emphasis>PASS</emphasis> is in some sense more ambiguous than if
	  <emphasis>XPASS</emphasis> is also used.</para></listitem>
	</varlistentry>
 
        <varlistentry>
	  <term>FAIL</term>
	  <listitem><para>A test has produced the bug it was intended to
	  capture.  That is, it has demonstrated that the assertion is false.
	  The <emphasis>FAIL</emphasis> message is based on the test case only.
	  Other messages are used to indicate a failure of the framework. As
	  with <emphasis>PASS</emphasis>, POSIX tests must return
	  <emphasis>FAIL</emphasis> rather than <emphasis>XFAIL</emphasis> even
	  if a failure was expected.</para></listitem>
	</varlistentry>
 
        <varlistentry>
	  <term>UNRESOLVED</term>
	  <listitem><para>A test produced indeterminate results.  Usually, this
	  means the test executed in an unexpected fashion; this outcome
	  requires that a human being go over results, to determine if the test
	  should have passed or failed.  This message is also used for any test
	  that requires human intervention because it is beyond the abilities
	  of the testing framework.  Any unresolved test should resolved to
	  <emphasis>PASS</emphasis> or <emphasis>FAIL</emphasis> before a test
	  run can be considered finished.</para>

	  <para>Note that for POSIX, each assertion must produce a test result
	  code.  If the test isn't actually run, it must produce
	  <emphasis>UNRESOLVED</emphasis> rather than just leaving that test
	  out of the output.  This means that you have to be careful when
	  writing tests, to not carelessly use tcl statements like
	  <emphasis>return</emphasis>---if you alter the flow of control of the
	  tcl code you must insure that every test still produces some result
	  code.</para>

	  <para>Here are some of the ways a test may wind up
	  <emphasis>UNRESOLVED</emphasis>:</para></listitem>

	</varlistentry>
	</variablelist>

          <itemizedlist mark=bullet>
	    <listitem><para>A test's execution is
	    interrupted.</para></listitem>

	    <listitem><para>A test does not produce a clear
	    result. This is usually because there was an
	    <emphasis>ERROR</emphasis> from DejaGnu while processing
	    the test, or because there were three or more
	    <emphasis>WARNING</emphasis> messages. Any
	    <emphasis>WARNING</emphasis> or <emphasis>ERROR</emphasis>
	    messages can invalidate the output of the test.  This
	    usually requires a human being to examine the output to
	    determine what really happened---and to improve the test
	    case.</para></listitem>

	    <listitem><para>A test depends on a previous test, which
	    fails.</para></listitem>

	    <listitem><para>The test was set up
	    incorrectly.</para></listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>	  
	    <term>UNTESTED</term>
	    <listitem><para>A test was not run.  This is a placeholder, used
	    when there is no real test case yet.</para></listitem>
	  </varlistentry>
	</variablelist>

	  <para>The only remaining output message left is intended to test
	  features that are specified by the applicable POSIX standard as
	  conditional:</para>

	<variablelist>
	  <varlistentry>	  
  	    <term>UNSUPPORTED</term>
	    <listitem><para>There is no support for the tested case.  This may
  	    mean that a conditional feature of an operating system, or of a
  	    compiler, is not implemented.  DejaGnu also uses this message when
  	    a testing environment (often a ``bare board'' target) lacks basic
  	    support for compiling or running the test case.  For example, a
  	    test for the system subroutine <emphasis>gethostname</emphasis>
  	    would never work on a target board running only a boot
  	    monitor.</para></listitem>
	  </varlistentry>	  
	</variablelist>
  
        <para>DejaGnu uses the same output procedures to produce these messages
	for all test suites, and these procedures are already known to conform
	to POSIX 1003.3.  For a DejaGnu test suite to conform to POSIX 1003.3,
	you must avoid the <emphasis>setup</emphasis>xfail} procedure as
	described in the <emphasis>PASS</emphasis> section above, and you must
	be careful to return <emphasis>UNRESOLVED</emphasis> where appropriate,
	as described in the <emphasis>UNRESOLVED</emphasis> section
	above.</para>
