-------------------------------------------------------------
 Please note that in some of the above alternate licenses, there is a
 statement regarding that acknowledgement must be made in any
 advertising materials for products using the code.  This restriction
 no longer applies due to the following license change:

  ftp://ftp.cs.berkeley.edu/pub/4bsd/README.Impt.License.Change

 In some cases the defunct clause has been removed in modified newlib code and
 in some cases, the clause has been left as-is.
