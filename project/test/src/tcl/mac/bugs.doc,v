@Known bug list for Tcl 8.0 for Macintosh

by Ray Johnson
Sun Microsystems Laboratories
rjohnson@@eng.sun.com

RCS: @@(#) $Id: bugs.doc,v 1.4 2000/02/10 08:39:37 jingham Exp $

This was a new feature as of Tcl7.6b1 and as such I'll started with
a clean slate.  I currently know of no reproducable bugs.  I often
get vague reports - but nothing I've been able to confirm.  Let
me know what bugs you find!

The Macintosh version of Tcl passes most all tests in the Tcl
test suite.  Slower Macs may fail some tests in event.test whose
timing constraints are too tight.  If other tests fail please report
them.

Ray

Known bugs in the current release.

* With the socket code you can't use the "localhost" host name.  This
  is actually a known bug in Apple's MacTcp stack.  However, you can
  use [info hostname] whereever you would have used "localhost" to 
  achive the same effect.

* Most socket bugs have been fixed.  We do have a couple of test cases
  that will hang the Mac, however, and we are still working on them.
  If you find additional test cases that show crashes please let us
  know!

* In Tcl 8.2, the new Regexp code seems to be more deeply recursive than
the older version in Tcl8.0.  As a result, I have had to increase the Stack
size of Tcl to 1Meg.  If you are not doing regexps with many subexpressions,
this is probably more stack than you will need.  You can relink with the 
stack set to 512K, and you will be fine for most purposes.
* This regexp problem is fixed in Tcl8.3.  If you are going to do complex
regexp's, it is probably a good idea to keep the stack size big.  But normal
regexps will not cause crashes.

* The "clock scan -base" command does not work.  The epoch is wrong.
* The file mtime command does not work when setting the time, it is off
by 4 years.

* In Tcl 8.2, the new Regexp code seems to be more deeply recursive than
the older version in Tcl8.0.  As a result, I have had to increase the Stack
size of Tcl to 1Meg.  If you are not doing regexps with many subexpressions,
this is probably more stack than you will need.  You can relink with the 
stack set to 512K, and you will be fine for most purposes.
* This regexp problem is fixed in Tcl8.3.  If you are going to do complex
regexp's, it is probably a good idea to keep the stack size big.  But normal
regexps will not cause crashes.

* The "clock scan -base" command does not work.  The epoch is wrong.
* The file mtime command does not work when setting the time, it is off
by 4 years.

We are now very close to passing the test suite for Tk.  We are very
interested in finding remaining bugs that still linger.  Please let us
know (and send us test cases) of any bugs you find.

Known bugs:

* Transient windows (set by wm transient) do not go away when the
  master does.

* Tearoff menus should be floating windows & floating windows should
  float.  They also shouldn't be resizable.

* The -use and -container windows only work with other Tk windows in
  the same process.  Also, if you try really hard (for instance by binding 
  on Destroy of an embedded window and destroying the container's toplevel) 
  you can get Tk to crash.  This should never be necessary, however, since
  the destruction of the embedded window triggers the destruction of the
  container, so you can watch that instead.
  All the focus bugs in Tk8.0 have been fixed, however.
  
* The send command is only implemented within the same app.

* You cannot color buttons, and the indicators for radiobuttons and
  checkbuttons under Appearance.  They will always use the current
  Theme color.  But, then, you are not supposed to...

* Drawing is not really correct.  This shows up mostly in the canvas
  when line widths are greater than one.  Unfortunantly, this will not
  be easy to fix.
  
* The active menu highlight color in Tearoff menus will not match the system-wide
  menu highlight color under Appearance.  It will be black instead.  This is not
  easy to fix, since the Appearance API's don't really allow you to get your hands
  on this information...

This was a new feature as of Tcl7.6b1 and as such I'll started with
a clean slate.  I currently know of no reproducable bugs.  I often
get vague reports - but nothing I've been able to confirm.  Let
me know what bugs you find!

The Macintosh version of Tcl passes most all tests in the Tcl
test suite.  Slower Macs may fail some tests in event.test whose
timing constraints are too tight.  If other tests fail please report
them.

Known bugs in the current release.

* With the socket code you can't use the "localhost" host name.  This
  is actually a known bug in Apple's MacTcp stack.  However, you can
  use [info hostname] whereever you would have used "localhost" to 
  achive the same effect.

* Most socket bugs have been fixed.  We do have a couple of test cases
  that will hang the Mac, however, and we are still working on them.
  If you find additional test cases that show crashes please let us
  know!

* In Tcl 8.2, the new Regexp code seems to be more deeply recursive than
the older version in Tcl8.0.  As a result, I have had to increase the Stack
size of Tcl to 1Meg.  If you are not doing regexps with many subexpressions,
