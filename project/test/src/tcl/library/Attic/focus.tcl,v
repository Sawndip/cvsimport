# a given window.  It returns 1 if it's OK to focus on the window,

# viewable.  If not, then it never focuses on the window.  Then it
# checks the -takefocus option for the window and uses it if it's
# set.  If there's no -takefocus option, the procedure checks to
# see if (a) the widget isn't disabled, and (b) it has some key
# bindings.  If all of these are true, then 1 is returned.
#
# Arguments:
# w -		Name of a window.
