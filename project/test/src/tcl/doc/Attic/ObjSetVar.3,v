.SH NAME
Tcl_ObjSetVar2, Tcl_ObjGetVar2 \- manipulate Tcl variables
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
\fB#include <tcl.h>\fR
.sp
Tcl_Obj *
\fBTcl_ObjSetVar2\fR(\fIinterp, part1Ptr, part2Ptr, newValuePtr, flags\fR)
.sp
Tcl_Obj *
\fBTcl_ObjGetVar2\fR(\fIinterp, part1Ptr, part2Ptr, flags\fR)
.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS Tcl_Interp *newValuePtr
.AP Tcl_Interp *interp in
Interpreter containing variable.
.AP Tcl_Obj *part1Ptr in
Points to a Tcl object containing the variable's name.
The name may include a series of \fB::\fR namespace qualifiers
to specify a variable in a particular namespace.
May refer to a scalar variable or an element of an array variable.
.AP Tcl_Obj *part2Ptr in
If non-NULL, points to an object containing the name of an element
within an array and \fIpart1Ptr\fR must refer to an array variable.
.AP Tcl_Obj *newValuePtr in
Points to a Tcl object containing the new value for the variable.
.AP int flags in
OR-ed combination of bits providing additional information for
operation. See below for valid values.
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
These two procedures may be used to read and modify
Tcl variables from C code.
\fBTcl_ObjSetVar2\fR will create a new variable or modify an existing one.
It sets the specified variable to
the object referenced by \fInewValuePtr\fR
and returns a pointer to the object which is the variable's new value.
The returned object may not be the same one
referenced by \fInewValuePtr\fR;
this might happen because variable traces may modify the variable's value.
The reference count for the variable's old value is decremented
and the reference count for its new value is incremented.
If the new value for the variable
is not the same one referenced by \fInewValuePtr\fR
(perhaps as a result of a variable trace),
then \fInewValuePtr\fR's reference count is left unchanged.
The reference count for the returned object is not incremented
to reflect the returned reference.
If the caller needs to keep a reference to the object,
say in a data structure,
it must increment its reference count using \fBTcl_IncrRefCount\fR.
If an error occurs in setting the variable
(e.g. an array variable is referenced
without giving an index into the array),
then NULL is returned.
.PP
The variable name specified to \fBTcl_ObjSetVar2\fR consists of two parts.
\fIpart1Ptr\fR contains the name of a scalar or array variable.
If \fIpart2Ptr\fR is NULL, the variable must be a scalar.
If \fIpart2Ptr\fR is not NULL,
it contains the name of an element in the array named by \fIpart2Ptr\fR.
As a special case, if the flag TCL_PARSE_PART1 is specified,
\fIpart1Ptr\fR may contain both an array and an element name:
if the name contains an open parenthesis and ends with a
close parenthesis, then the value between the parentheses is
treated as an element name (which can have any string value) and
the characters before the first open
parenthesis are treated as the name of an array variable.
If the flag TCL_PARSE_PART1 is given,
\fIpart2Ptr\fR should be NULL since the array and element names
are taken from \fIpart2Ptr\fR.
.PP
The \fIflags\fR argument may be used to specify any of several
options to the procedures.
It consists of an OR-ed combination of any of the following
bits:
.TP
\fBTCL_GLOBAL_ONLY\fR
Under normal circumstances the procedures look up variables as follows:
If a procedure call is active in \fIinterp\fR,
a variable is looked up at the current level of procedure call.
Otherwise, a variable is looked up first in the current namespace,
then in the global namespace.
However, if this bit is set in \fIflags\fR then the variable
is looked up only in the global namespace
even if there is a procedure call active.
If both \fBTCL_GLOBAL_ONLY\fR and \fBTCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY\fR are given,
\fBTCL_GLOBAL_ONLY\fR is ignored.
.TP
\fBTCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY\fR
Under normal circumstances the procedures look up variables as follows:
If a procedure call is active in \fIinterp\fR,
a variable is looked up at the current level of procedure call.
Otherwise, a variable is looked up first in the current namespace,
then in the global namespace.
However, if this bit is set in \fIflags\fR then the variable
is looked up only in the current namespace
even if there is a procedure call active.
.TP
\fBTCL_LEAVE_ERR_MSG\fR
If an error is returned and this bit is set in \fIflags\fR, then
an error message will be left in the interpreter's result,
where it can be retrieved with \fBTcl_GetObjResult\fR
or \fBTcl_GetStringResult\fR.
If this flag bit isn't set then no error message is left
and the interpreter's result will not be modified.
.TP
\fBTCL_APPEND_VALUE\fR
If this bit is set then \fInewValuePtr\fR is appended to the current
value, instead of replacing it.
If the variable is currently undefined, then this bit is ignored.
.TP
\fBTCL_LIST_ELEMENT\fR
If this bit is set, then \fInewValuePtr\fR is converted to a valid
Tcl list element before setting (or appending to) the variable.
A separator space is appended before the new list element unless
the list element is going to be the first element in a list or
sublist (i.e. the variable's current value is empty, or contains
the single character ``{'', or ends in `` }'').
.TP
\fBTCL_PARSE_PART1\fR
If this bit is set,
then \fBTcl_ObjGetVar2\fR and \fBTcl_ObjSetVar2\fR
will parse \fIpart1Ptr\fR
to obtain both an array name and an element name.
If the name in \fIpart1Ptr\fR contains an open parenthesis
and ends with a close parenthesis,
the name is treated as the name of an element of an array;
otherwise, the name in \fIpart1Ptr\fR
is interpreted as the name of a scalar variable.
When this bit is set,
\fIpart2Ptr\fR is ignored.
.PP
\fBTcl_ObjGetVar2\fR returns the value of the specified variable.
Its arguments are treated the same way as those for \fBTcl_ObjSetVar2\fR.
It returns a pointer to the object which is the variable's value.
The reference count for the returned object is not incremented.
If the caller needs to keep a reference to the object,
say in a data structure,
it must increment the reference count using \fBTcl_IncrRefCount\fR.
If an error occurs in setting the variable
(e.g. an array variable is referenced
without giving an index into the array),
then NULL is returned.
