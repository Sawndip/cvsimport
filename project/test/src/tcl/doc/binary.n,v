.SH NAME
binary \- Insert and extract fields from binary strings
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBbinary format \fIformatString \fR?\fIarg arg ...\fR?
.br
\fBbinary scan \fIstring formatString \fR?\fIvarName varName ...\fR?
.BE

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
This command provides facilities for manipulating binary data.  The
first form, \fBbinary format\fR, creates a binary string from normal
Tcl values.  For example, given the values 16 and 22, on a 32 bit
architecture, it might produce an 8-byte binary string consisting of
two 4-byte integers, one for each of the numbers.  The second form of
the command, \fBbinary scan\fR, does the opposite: it extracts data
from a binary string and returns it as ordinary Tcl string values.

.SH "BINARY FORMAT"
.PP
The \fBbinary format\fR command generates a binary string whose layout
is specified by the \fIformatString\fR and whose contents come from
the additional arguments.  The resulting binary value is returned.
.PP
The \fIformatString\fR consists of a sequence of zero or more field
specifiers separated by zero or more spaces.  Each field specifier is
a single type character followed by an optional numeric \fIcount\fR.
Most field specifiers consume one argument to obtain the value to be
formatted.  The type character specifies how the value is to be
formatted.  The \fIcount\fR typically indicates how many items of the
specified type are taken from the value.  If present, the \fIcount\fR
is a non-negative decimal integer or \fB*\fR, which normally indicates
that all of the items in the value are to be used.  If the number of
arguments does not match the number of fields in the format string
that consume arguments, then an error is generated.
.PP
Here is a small example to clarify the relation between the field
specifiers and the arguments:
.CS
\fBbinary format d3d {1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0} 0.1\fR
.CE
.PP
The first argument is a list of four numbers, but because of the count
of 3 for the associated field specifier, only the first three will be
used. The second argument is associated with the second field
specifier. The resulting binary string contains the four numbers 10,
2.0, 3.0 and 0.1.
.PP
Each type-count pair moves an imaginary cursor through the binary
data, storing bytes at the current position and advancing the cursor
to just after the last byte stored.  The cursor is initially at
position 0 at the beginning of the data.  The type may be any one of
the following characters:
.IP \fBa\fR 5
Stores a character string of length \fIcount\fR in the output string.
If \fIarg\fR has fewer than \fIcount\fR bytes, then additional zero
bytes are used to pad out the field.  If \fIarg\fR is longer than the
specified length, the extra characters will be ignored.  If
\fIcount\fR is \fB*\fR, then all of the bytes in \fIarg\fR will be
formatted.  If \fIcount\fR is omitted, then one character will be
formatted.  For example,
.RS
.CS
\fBbinary format a7a*a alpha bravo charlie\fR
.CE
will return a string equivalent to \fBalpha\\000\\000bravoc\fR.
.RE
.IP \fBA\fR 5
This form is the same as \fBa\fR except that spaces are used for
padding instead of nulls.  For example,
.RS
.CS
\fBbinary format A6A*A alpha bravo charlie\fR
.CE
will return \fBalpha bravoc\fR.

.SH "BINARY SCAN"
.PP
The \fBbinary scan\fR command parses fields from a binary string,
returning the number of conversions performed.  \fIString\fR gives the
input to be parsed and \fIformatString\fR indicates how to parse it.
Each \fIvarName\fR gives the name of a variable; when a field is
scanned from \fIstring\fR the result is assigned to the corresponding
variable.
.PP
As with \fBbinary format\fR, the \fIformatString\fR consists of a
sequence of zero or more field specifiers separated by zero or more
spaces.  Each field specifier is a single type character followed by
an optional numeric \fIcount\fR.  Most field specifiers consume one
argument to obtain the variable into which the scanned values should
be placed.  The type character specifies how the binary data is to be
interpreted.  The \fIcount\fR typically indicates how many items of
the specified type are taken from the data.  If present, the
\fIcount\fR is a non-negative decimal integer or \fB*\fR, which
normally indicates that all of the remaining items in the data are to
be used.  If there are not enough bytes left after the current cursor
position to satisfy the current field specifier, then the
corresponding variable is left untouched and \fBbinary scan\fR returns
immediately with the number of variables that were set.  If there are
not enough arguments for all of the fields in the format string that
consume arguments, then an error is generated.
.PP
A similar example as with \fBbinary format\fR should explain the
relation between field specifiers and arguments in case of the binary
scan subcommand:
.CS
\fBbinary scan $bytes s3s first second\fR
.CE
.PP
This command (provided the binary string in the variable \fIbytes\fR
is long enough) assigns a list of three integers to the variable
\fIfirst\fR and assigns a single value to the variable \fIsecond\fR.
If \fIbytes\fR contains fewer than 8 bytes (i.e. four 2-byte
integers), no assignment to \fIsecond\fR will be made, and if
\fIbytes\fR contains fewer than 6 bytes (i.e. three 2-byte integers),
no assignment to \fIfirst\fR will be made.  Hence:
.CS
\fBputs [binary scan abcdefg s3s first second]\fR
\fBputs $first\fR
\fBputs $second\fR
.CE
will print (assuming neither variable is set previously):
.CS
\fB1\fR
\fB25185 25699 26213\fR
\fIcan't read "second": no such variable\fR
.CE
.PP
It is \fBimportant\fR to note that the \fBc\fR, \fBs\fR, and \fBS\fR
(and \fBi\fR and \fBI\fR on 64bit systems) will be scanned into
long data size values.  In doing this, values that have their high
bit set (0x80 for chars, 0x8000 for shorts, 0x80000000 for ints),
will be sign extended.  Thus the following will occur:
.CS
\fBset signShort [binary format s1 0x8000]\fR
\fBbinary scan $signShort s1 val; \fI# val == 0xFFFF8000\fR
.CE
If you want to produce an unsigned value, then you can mask the return 
value to the desired size.  For example, to produce an unsigned short 
value:
.CS
\fBset val [expr {$val & 0xFFFF}]; \fI# val == 0x8000\fR
.CE
.PP
Each type-count pair moves an imaginary cursor through the binary data,

Tcl values.  For example, given the values 16 and 22, on a 32 bit
architecture, it might produce an 8-byte binary string consisting of
two 4-byte integers, one for each of the numbers.  The second form of
the command, \fBbinary scan\fR, does the opposite: it extracts data
from a binary string and returns it as ordinary Tcl string values.

Here is a small example to clarify the relation between the field
specifiers and the arguments:
.CS
\fBbinary format d3d {1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0} 0.1\fR
.CE
.PP
The first argument is a list of four numbers, but because of the count
of 3 for the associated field specifier, only the first three will be
used. The second argument is associated with the second field
specifier. The resulting binary string contains the four numbers 10,
2.0, 3.0 and 0.1.

It is \fBimportant\fR to note that the \fBc\fR, \fBs\fR, and \fBS\fR
(and \fBi\fR and \fBI\fR on 64bit systems) will be scanned into
long data size values.  In doing this, values that have their high
bit set (0x80 for chars, 0x8000 for shorts, 0x80000000 for ints),

If you want to produce an unsigned value, then you can mask the return
