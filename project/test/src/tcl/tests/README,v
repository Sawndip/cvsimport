@README -- Tcl test suite design document.

RCS: @@(#) $Id: README,v 1.11 2002/08/08 14:50:51 dgp Exp $

Contents:
---------

    1. Introduction
    2. Incompatibilities with prior Tcl versions

1. Introduction:
----------------

This directory contains a set of validation tests for the Tcl commands
and C Library procedures for Tcl.  Each of the files whose name ends
in ".test" is intended to fully exercise the functions in the C source
file that corresponds to the file prefix.  The C functions and/or Tcl
commands tested by a given file are listed in the first line of the
file.

You can run the tests in three ways:

    (a) type "make test" in ../unix; this will create the tcltest
	executable and run all of the tests.  At least "make tcltest"
	must be run to create the tcltest executable for the other
	options.

    (b) type "tcltest <testFile> ?<option> <value>?

	where the options and values are the configuration options
	of the tcltest package.
 
    (c) start up tcltest in this directory, then "source" the test
        file (for example, type "source parse.test").  To run all
	of the tests, type "source all.tcl".  To use the options in
	interactive mode, you can set them with the tcltest::configure
	command.  Set constraints with the tcltest::testConstraints
	command.

Please see the tcltest man page for more information regarding how to
write and run tests.

Please note that the all.tcl file will source your new test file if
the filename matches the tests/*.test pattern (as it should).  The
names of test files that contain regression (or glass-box) tests
should correspond to the Tcl or C code file that they are testing.
For example, the test file for the C file "tclCmdAH.c" is
"cmdAH.test".  Test files that contain black-box tests may not
correspond to any Tcl or C code file so they should match the pattern
"*_bb.test". 

Be sure your new test file can be run from any working directory.

Be sure no temporary files are left behind by your test file.
Use [tcltest::makeFile], [tcltest::removeFile], and [tcltest::cleanupTests]
properly to be sure of this.

Be sure your tests can run cross-platform in both a build environment
as well as an installation environment.  If your test file contains
tests that should not be run in one or more of those cases, please use
the constraints mechanism to skip those tests.

2. Incompatibilities of package tcltest 2.1 with 
   testing machinery of very old versions of Tcl:
------------------------------------------------

1) Global variables such as VERBOSE, TESTS, and testConfig of the
   old machinery correspond to the [configure -verbose], 
   [configure -match], and [testConstraint] commands of tcltest 2.1,
   respectively.

2) VERBOSE values were longer numeric.  [configure -verbose] values
   are lists of keywords.

3) When you run "make test", the working dir for the test suite is now
   the one from which you called "make test", rather than the "tests"
   directory.  This change allows for both unix and windows test
   suites to be run simultaneously without interference with each
   other or with existing files.  All tests must now run independently
   of their working directory.

4) The "all" file is now called "all.tcl"

5) The "defs" and "defs.tcl" files no longer exist.

6) Instead of creating a doAllTests file in the tests directory, to
   run all nonPortable tests, just use the "-constraints nonPortable"
   command line flag.  If you are running interactively, you can run
   [tcltest::testConstraint nonPortable 1] (after loading the tcltest
   package).

Tcl Test Suite

This directory contains a set of validation tests for the Tcl
commands.  Each of the files whose name ends in ".test" is
intended to fully exercise one or a few Tcl commands.  The
commands tested by a given file are listed in the first line
of the file.
a22 1
You can run the tests in two ways:
d24 61
a84 1
    (b) start up tcltest in this directory, then "source" the test
d86 62
a147 81
	of the tests, type "source all".
In either case no output will be generated if all goes well, except
for a listing of the tests..  If there are errors then additional
messages will appear in the format described below.  Note: don't
run the tests as superuser, since this will cause several of the tests
to fail.

The rest of this file provides additional information on the
features of the testing environment.

This approach to testing was designed and initially implemented
by Mary Ann May-Pumphrey of Sun Microsystems.  Many thanks to
her for donating her work back to the public Tcl release.

Definitions file:
-----------------

The file "defs" defines a collection of procedures and variables
used to run the tests.  It is read in automatically by each of the
.test files if needed, but once it has been read once it will not
be read again by the .test files.  If you change defs while running
tests you'll have to "source" it by hand to load its new contents.

Test output:
------------

Normally, output only appears when there are errors.  However, if
the variable VERBOSE is set to 1 then tests will be run in "verbose"
mode and output will be generated for each test regardless of
whether it succeeded or failed.  Test output consists of the
following information:

    - the test identifier (which can be used to locate the test code
	    in the .test file)
    - a brief description of the test
    - the contents of the test code
    - the actual results produced by the tests
    - a "PASSED" or "FAILED" message
    - the expected results (if the test failed)

You can set VERBOSE either interactively (after the defs file has been
read in), or you can change the default value in "defs".

Selecting tests for execution:
------------------------------

Normally, all the tests in a file are run whenever the file is
"source"d.  However, you can select a specific set of tests using
the global variable TESTS.  This variable contains a pattern;  any
test whose identifier matches TESTS will be run.  For example,
the following interactive command causes all of the "for" tests in
groups 2 and 4 to be executed:

    set TESTS {for-[24]*}

TESTS defaults to *, but you can change the default in "defs" if
you wish.

Saving keystrokes:
------------------

A convenience procedure named "dotests" is included in file
"defs".  It takes two arguments--the name of the test file (such
as "parse.test"), and a pattern selecting the tests you want to
execute.  It sets TESTS to the second argument, calls "source" on
the file specified in the first argument, and restores TESTS to
its pre-call value at the end.

Batch vs. interactive execution:
--------------------------------

The tests can be run in either batch or interactive mode.  Batch
mode refers to using I/O redirection from a UNIX shell.  For example,
the following command causes the tests in the file named "parse.test"
to be executed:

    tclTest < parse.test > parse.test.results

Users who want to execute the tests in this fashion need to first
ensure that the file "defs" has proper values for the global
variables that control the testing environment (VERBOSE and TESTS).

    1. Introduction
    2. Incompatibilities with prior Tcl versions

1. Introduction:
----------------

This directory contains a set of validation tests for the Tcl commands
and C Library procedures for Tcl.  Each of the files whose name ends
in ".test" is intended to fully exercise the functions in the C source
file that corresponds to the file prefix.  The C functions and/or Tcl
commands tested by a given file are listed in the first line of the
file.

You can run the tests in three ways:
d12 1
d14 1
a14 61

    (b) type "tcltest <testFile> ?<option> <value>?
	Command line options include:

	-help                display usage information

	-verbose <level>     set the level of verbosity to a substring
			     of "bps".  See the "Test output" section
			     of the tcltest man page for an
			     explanation of this option. 

	-match <matchList>   only run tests that match one or more of
			     the glob patterns in <matchList>

	-skip <skipList>     do not run tests that match one or more
			     of the glob patterns in <skipList>

	-file <globPatternList>  
		             only source test files that match one or
		             more of the glob patterns in
		             <globPatternList> (relative to the
		             "tests" directory).  This option only
		             applies when you run the test suite with
		             the "all.tcl" file.

	-notfile <globPatternList>  
	                     do not source test files that match one
	                     or more of the patterns in
	                     <globPatternList> (relative to the
	                     "tests" directory).  This option only
	                     applies when you run the test suite with
	                     the "all.tcl" file.

	-constraints <list>  tests with any constraints in <list> will
			     not be skipped.  Not that elements of
			     <list> must exactly match the existing
			     constraints.

        -limitconstraints <bool>
                             If 1, limit test runs to those tests that
                             match the constraints listed using the
                             -constraints flag.  Use of this flag
                             requires use of the -constraints flag.
                             The default value is 0.

        -tmpdir <dirname>    put temporary files created by
                             ::tcltest::makeFile and
                             ::tcltest::makeDirectory in the named
                             directory.  The default location is
                             ::tcltest::workingDirectory.

        -preservecore <level>
                             check for core files.  If level is 0,
                             check for core files only when
                             cleanupTests is called from an all.tcl
                             file.  If 1, also check at the end of
                             every test command.  If 2, also save core
                             files in ::tcltest::temporaryDirectory.
                             The default level is 0.
 
    (c) start up tcltest in this directory, then "source" the test
d16 81
a96 62
	of the tests, type "source all.tcl".  To use the options in
	interactive mode, you can set their corresponding tcltest
	namespace variables after loading the tcltest package.
	For example, some of the tcltest variables are:
		  ::tcltest::match
		  ::tcltest::skip
		  ::tcltest::testConstraints(nonPortable)
		  ::tcltest::testConstraints(knownBug)
		  ::tcltest::testConstraints(userInteractive)

Please see the tcltest man page for more information regarding how to
write and run tests.

Please note that the all.tcl file will source your new test file if
the filename matches the tests/*.test pattern (as it should).  The
names of test files that contain regression (or glass-box) tests
should correspond to the Tcl or C code file that they are testing.
For example, the test file for the C file "tclCmdAH.c" is
"cmdAH.test".  Test files that contain black-box tests may not
correspond to any Tcl or C code file so they should match the pattern
"*_bb.test". 

Be sure your new test file can be run from any working directory.

Be sure no temporary files are left behind by your test file.

Be sure your tests can run cross-platform in both a build environment
as well as an installation environment.  If your test file contains
tests that should not be run in one or more of those cases, please use
the constraints mechanism to skip those tests.

2. Incompatibilities with prior Tcl versions:
---------------------------------------------

1) Global variables such as VERBOSE, TESTS, and testConfig are now
   renamed to use the new "tcltest" namespace.

   old name   new name
   --------   --------
   VERBOSE    ::tcltest::verbose
   TESTS      ::tcltest::match
   testConfig ::tcltest::testConstraints

2) VERBOSE values are no longer numeric.  

3) When you run "make test", the working dir for the test suite is now
   the one from which you called "make test", rather than the "tests"
   directory.  This change allows for both unix and windows test
   suites to be run simultaneously without interference with each
   other or with existing files.  All tests must now run independently
   of their working directory.

4) The "all" and "visual" files are now called "all.tcl" and
   "visual_bb.test".

5) The "defs" file no longer exists.

6) Instead of creating a doAllTests file in the tests directory, to
   run all nonPortable tests, just use the "-constraints nonPortable"
   command line flag.  If you are running interactively, you can set
   the ::tcltest::testConstraints(nonPortable) variable to 1 (after
   loading the tcltest package).

    1. Introduction
    2. Incompatibilities with prior Tcl versions

1. Introduction:
----------------

This directory contains a set of validation tests for the Tcl commands
and C Library procedures for Tcl.  Each of the files whose name ends
in ".test" is intended to fully exercise the functions in the C source
file that corresponds to the file prefix.  The C functions and/or Tcl
commands tested by a given file are listed in the first line of the
file.

You can run the tests in three ways:

    (a) type "make test" in ../unix; this will create the tcltest
	executable and run all of the tests.  At least "make tcltest"
	must be run to create the tcltest executable for the other
	options.

    (b) type "tcltest <testFile> ?<option> <value>?

	where the options and values are the configuration options
	of the tcltest package.
 
    (c) start up tcltest in this directory, then "source" the test
        file (for example, type "source parse.test").  To run all
	of the tests, type "source all.tcl".  To use the options in
	interactive mode, you can set them with the tcltest::configure
	command.  Set constraints with the tcltest::testConstraints
	command.

Please see the tcltest man page for more information regarding how to
write and run tests.

Please note that the all.tcl file will source your new test file if
the filename matches the tests/*.test pattern (as it should).  The
names of test files that contain regression (or glass-box) tests
should correspond to the Tcl or C code file that they are testing.
For example, the test file for the C file "tclCmdAH.c" is
"cmdAH.test".  Test files that contain black-box tests may not
correspond to any Tcl or C code file so they should match the pattern
"*_bb.test". 

Be sure your new test file can be run from any working directory.

Be sure no temporary files are left behind by your test file.
Use [tcltest::makeFile], [tcltest::removeFile], and [tcltest::cleanupTests]
properly to be sure of this.

Be sure your tests can run cross-platform in both a build environment
as well as an installation environment.  If your test file contains
tests that should not be run in one or more of those cases, please use
the constraints mechanism to skip those tests.

2. Incompatibilities of package tcltest 2.1 with 
   testing machinery of very old versions of Tcl:
------------------------------------------------

1) Global variables such as VERBOSE, TESTS, and testConfig of the
   old machinery correspond to the [configure -verbose], 
   [configure -match], and [testConstraint] commands of tcltest 2.1,
   respectively.

2) VERBOSE values were longer numeric.  [configure -verbose] values
   are lists of keywords.

3) When you run "make test", the working dir for the test suite is now
   the one from which you called "make test", rather than the "tests"
   directory.  This change allows for both unix and windows test
   suites to be run simultaneously without interference with each
   other or with existing files.  All tests must now run independently
   of their working directory.

4) The "all" file is now called "all.tcl"

5) The "defs" and "defs.tcl" files no longer exist.

6) Instead of creating a doAllTests file in the tests directory, to
   run all nonPortable tests, just use the "-constraints nonPortable"
   command line flag.  If you are running interactively, you can run
   [tcltest::testConstraint nonPortable 1] (after loading the tcltest
   package).
