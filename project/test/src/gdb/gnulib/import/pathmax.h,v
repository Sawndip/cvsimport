@Import the "pathmax" gnulib module.

This imports the "pathmax" gnulib module, making PATH_MAX always
available on systems that have the notion of a constant max path limit
(i.e., practically everywhere except the Hurd), along with fixing a
couple broken systems --- see pathmax.h in the patch.

This means we can normalize on PATH_MAX throughout the tree (instead
of some places using MAXPATHLEN, or defining fallback constants
ourselves).

This is the just the importing step.

   PATH_MAX is not defined on systems which have no limit on filename length,
   such as GNU/Hurd.

   This file does *not* define PATH_MAX always.  Programs that use this file
   can handle the GNU/Hurd case in several ways:
     - Either with a package-wide handling, or with a per-file handling,
     - Either through a
         #ifdef PATH_MAX
       or through a fallback like
         #ifndef PATH_MAX
         # define PATH_MAX 8192
         #endif
       or through a fallback like
         #ifndef PATH_MAX
