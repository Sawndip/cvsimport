# AC_DEFUN_ONCE([NAME], VALUE)
# ----------------------------
# Define NAME to expand to VALUE on the first use (whether by direct
# expansion, or by AC_REQUIRE), and to nothing on all subsequent uses.
# Avoid bugs in AC_REQUIRE in Autoconf 2.63 and earlier.  This
# definition is slower than the version in Autoconf 2.64, because it
# can only use interfaces that existed since 2.59; but it achieves the
# same effect.  Quoting is necessary to avoid confusing Automake.
