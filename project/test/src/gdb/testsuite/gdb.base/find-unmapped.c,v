@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.

    Map enough pages to cover at least CHUNK_SIZE, and one extra page.  We

    If CHUNK_SIZE equals page size then we'll get 3 pages, and if
    CHUNK_SIZE is less than page size we'll get 2 pages.  The test will
    still work in these cases.

    (1) We do a find from global_var_0 to global_var_2, this will fail when
    loading the second chunk, as we know at least CHUNK_SIZE bytes are in
    mapped space.

    (2) We do a find from global_var_1 to global_var_2, this will fail when
    loading the first chunk, assuming the CHUNK_SIZE is at least 16 bytes.

    (3) We do a find from global_var_2 to (global_var_2 + 16), this too
    will fail when loading the first chunk regardless of the chunk size.
