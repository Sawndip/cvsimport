@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.

@http://sourceware.org/ml/gdb-patches/2010-12/msg00300.html
Improve the ordering of line table entries when dealing with the end
of sequence markers.  This will allow us to disassemble over the border
between two compile units while also displaying source code information.
