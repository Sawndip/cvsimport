1.1
log
@This patch  adds a new convenience variable called "$_exitsignal", which
will hold the signal number when the inferior terminates due to the
uncaught signal.

I've made modifications on infrun.c:handle_inferior_event such that
$_exitcode gets cleared when the inferior signalled, and vice-versa.
This assumption was made because the variables are mutually
exclusive, i.e., when the inferior terminates because of an uncaught
signal it is not possible for it to return.  I have also made modifications
such that when a corefile is loaded, $_exitsignal gets set to the uncaught
signal that "killed" the inferior, and $_exitcode is cleared.

The patch also adds a NEWS entry, documentation bits, and a testcase.  The
documentation entry explains how to use $_exitsignal and $_exitcode in a
GDB script, by making use of the new $_isvoid convenience function.
