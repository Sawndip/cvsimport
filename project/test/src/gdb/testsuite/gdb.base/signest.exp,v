@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.

@	gdb/
	* infrun.c (proceed): Revert previous change.
	(resume): Instead, handle the case of signal delivery while stepping
	off a breakpoint location here, and only if software single-stepping
	is used.  Handle nested signals.

	gdb/testsuite/
	* gdb.base/signest.exp: New file.
	* gdb.base/signest.c: Likewise.
