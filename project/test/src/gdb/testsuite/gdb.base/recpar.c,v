@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.

log
@Add testcase for locals identified with FUNCTION::VAR syntax.

This test stops inside a recursive function after a few levels of recursion,
goes up some frames, and then accesses a local variable with 'print foo::val'
rather than the usual 'print val' to see if the former pays attention to the
selected frame.
