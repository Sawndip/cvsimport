@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.

        * gdb.ada/homonym/pck.ads, gdb.ada/homonym/pck.adb: New files.
        * gdb.ada/homonym/homonym.adb: For use of all types defined
