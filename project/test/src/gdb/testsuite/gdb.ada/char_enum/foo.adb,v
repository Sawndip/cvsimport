@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.

@handle character-based enumeration typedefs

Consider the following type:

   type Char_Enum_Type is ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D');

If the compiler generates a Char_Enum_Type typedef in the debugging
information, the debugger fails in the following case:

   (gdb) p Char_Enum_Type'('B')
   $1 = 66

For our type, the underlying value of 'B' is actually 1, not 66
(ASCII 'B').  We are failing this case because we were not handling
typedef to enum types before.  This patch fixes this.

gdb/ChangeLog:

        * ada-exp.y (convert_char_literal): Handle typedef types.

gdb/testsuite/ChangeLog:

        * gdb.ada/char_enum: New testcase.
