@Accept "set foo unlimited" in integer/uinteger/zuinteger_unlimited commands.

Currently, several commands take "0" or "-1" to mean "unlimited".

"show" knows when to print "unlimited":

 (gdb) show height
 Number of lines gdb thinks are in a page is 45.
 (gdb) set height 0
 (gdb) show height
 Number of lines gdb thinks are in a page is unlimited.

However, the user can't herself specify "unlimited" directly:

 (gdb) set height unlimited
 No symbol table is loaded.  Use the "file" command.
 (gdb)

This patch addresses that, by adjusting the set handler for all
integer/uinteger/zuinteger_unlimited commands to accept literal
"unlimited".  It also installs a completer.  Presently, we complete on
symbols by default, and at
<http://sourceware.org/ml/gdb-patches/2013-03/msg00864.html> I've
shown a WIP prototype that tried to keep that half working in these
commands.  In the end, it turned out to be more complicated than
justifiable, IMO.  It's super rare to want to pass the value of a
variable/symbol in the program to a GDB set/show knob.  That'll still
work, it's just that we won't assist with completion anymore.  This
patch just sticks with the simple, and completes on "unlimited", and
nothing else.  This simplification means that

  "set he<tab><tab>"

is all it takes to get to:

  "set height unlimited"

The patch then goes through all integer/uinteger/zuinteger_unlimited
commands in the tree, and updates both the online help and the manual
to mention that "unlimited" is accepted in addition to 0/-1.  In the
cases where the command had no online help text at all, this adds it.
I've tried to make the texts read in a way that "unlimited" is
suggested before "0" or "-1" is.

Tested on x86_64 Fedora 17.
