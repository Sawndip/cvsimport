@Remove superfluous semicolons from testsuite throughout.

A few months ago semicolons after "return" were removed throughout the
testsuite.  However, as I pointed out in review, they're unnecessary
not just after "return", but pretty much after any tcl command.  ';'
is the command separator, and you only need it if there's another
command on the same line afterwards.

This patch was written by running:

 $ find . -name "*.exp" | xargs grep -l ";\s*$" | xargs sed -i 's/\([^#][^\s*;]*\)\s*;\s*$/\1/'

and then undoing changes to comments, and lib/future.exp.

Tested on x86_64 Fedora 17.

@range stepping: tests

This adds tests to verify range stepping is used as expected, by
inspecting the RSP traffic, looking for vCont;s and vCont;r packets.
