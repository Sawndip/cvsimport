@Resue 'z' formatter from mi register display code.

  http://sourceware.org/ml/gdb-patches/2013-07/msg00236.html

gdb/ChangeLog

        * mi/mi-main.c (output_register): Make MI 'r' format use standard
        'z' format code.  Remove error for optimized out values, standard
        code will handle these fine.

gdb/testsuite/ChangeLog

        * gdb.mi/mi-reg-undefined.exp: New file.
        * gdb.mi/mi-reg-undefined.c: Likewise.
        * gdb.mi/mi-reg-undefined.S: Likewise.
