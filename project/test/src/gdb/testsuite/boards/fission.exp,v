# This file is a dejagnu "board file" and is used to run the testsuite

#
# Example usage:
# bash$ make check RUNTESTFLAGS='--target_board=fission'

# This is copied from baseboards/unix.exp.
# At the moment this only supports things that unix.exp supports.

# for the linker.

# This is needed otherwise dejagnu tries to rsh to host "fission".  Blech.
# Double blech: set_board_info only sets the value if not already set.

@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.
