# This is needed otherwise dejagnu tries to rsh to host "dwarf4-gdb-index".
# set_board_info only sets the value if not already set.

@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.
