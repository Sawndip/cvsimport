@fix some gdb.dwarf2 tests for parallel safety

This fixes a few gdb.dwarf2 tests to be more parallel-safe.  This
mostly amounts to changing them to write their files into the
directory designated by standard_output_file.

Built and regtested on x86-64 Fedora 18.

	* gdb.dwarf2/clztest.exp: Use standard_testfile.
	* gdb.dwarf2/dw2-minsym-in-cu.exp: Use standard_testfile.
	* gdb.dwarf2/fission-base.S: Remove directory from
	DW_AT_GNU_dwo_name.
	* gdb.dwarf2/fission-base.exp: Use build_executable.  Set
	debug-file-directory.
	* gdb.dwarf2/fission-reread.S: Remove directory from
	DW_AT_GNU_dwo_name.
	* gdb.dwarf2/fission-reread.exp: Use build_executable.  Set
	debug-file-directory.

@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.
