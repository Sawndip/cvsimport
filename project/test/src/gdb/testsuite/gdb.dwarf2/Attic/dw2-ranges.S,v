	* Makefile.in: Update dependencies.
	* dwarf2read.c: Include "addrmap.h"
	(struct dwarf2_cu): New fields RANGES_OFFSET and HAS_RANGES_OFFSET.
	(dwarf2_ranges_read): New prototype.
	(dwarf2_build_psymtabs_hard): Initialize and prepare PSYMTABS_ADDRMAP.
	Add discontiguous range to PSYMTABS_ADDRMAP by DWARF2_RANGES_READ on
	HAS_RANGES_OFFSET, otherwise add there the contiguous range.
	(dwarf2_ranges_read): New parameter RANGES_PST, update the function
	comment for it.  Add the found ranges to RANGES_PST.  New variable
	BASEADDR, initialize it the common way.
	(dwarf2_get_pc_bounds): Update the caller for the new parameter.
	(read_partial_die): `DW_AT_ranges' now only sets RANGES_OFFSET and
	HAS_RANGES_OFFSET for the later processing.
	* objfiles.h (struct objfile): New field PSYMTABS_ADDRMAP.
	* symtab.c: Include "addrmap.h"
	(find_pc_sect_psymtab): Support reading the field PSYMTABS_ADDRMAP.
	Move the psymtab locator into ...
	(find_pc_sect_psymtab_closer): ... a new function.

	* gdb.dwarf2/dw2-ranges.S: Merge the secondary section with `.fini'.
	* gdb.dwarf2/dw2-ranges.exp: Compile also `dw2-ranges2.S' and
