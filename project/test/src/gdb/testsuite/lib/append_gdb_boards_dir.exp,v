@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.

# Make the boards under testsuite/boards automatically available to
# DejaGnu.  This is sourced by the `site.exp' file generated in the
# root of the testsuite's build directory.

# Append GDB's boards dir to DejaGnu's board dir list, making sure
# that that is the last boards dir in the list, so that boards found
# in directories appended to the list by either the global config
# site.exp, or in `$(dirname $DEJAGNU)/boards' override GDB's boards.
# Unfortunately, there's no standard way to get that behavior.  To
# make it happen, we trace all writes to the $boards_dirs global, and
# make sure our dir is always the last in the list.  This relies on
# the fact that DejaGnu always writes to this variable, even if just
# to set it to the empty list, which it does.
