	* lib/gdb.exp (build_executable_from_specs): Use gdb_compile_pthread,
	gdb_compile_shlib or gdb_compile_shlib_pthreads where appropriate.
	* lib/prelink-support.exp (build_executable_own_libs): Allow INTERP
	to be set to "no" to indicate that no ld.so copy should be made.
	* gdb.base/break-interp.exp (solib_bp): New constant.
	(reach_1): Use the above instead of "_dl_debug_state".
	(test_attach): Likewise.
	(test_ld): Likewise.
	* gdb.threads/dlopen-libpthread.exp: New file.
	* gdb.threads/dlopen-libpthread.c: Likewise.
	* gdb.threads/dlopen-libpthread-lib.c: Likewise.
	* gdb.base/solib-corrupted.exp: Disable test if GDB is using probes.
