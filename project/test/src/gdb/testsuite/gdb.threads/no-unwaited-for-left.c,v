@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.

@2011-10-28  Pedro Alves  <pedro@@codesourcery.com>

	gdb/
	* linux-nat.c (linux_nat_filter_event): Remove `options'
	parameter, and dead code that used it.  If we're handling a
	PTRACE_EVENT_EXEC event, and the thread group leader is no longer
	in our lwp list, re-add it.
	(check_zombie_leaders): New.
	(linux_nat_wait_1): Remove `options' and `pid' locals.  Always
	wait for children with WNOHANG, and always wait for all children.
	Don't check for no resumed children upfront.  Simplify wait loop.
	Check for zombie thread group leaders after handling all wait
	statuses.  Return TARGET_WAITKIND_NO_RESUMED if there no
	unwaited-for children left.
	* infrun.c (fetch_inferior_event): Handle TARGET_WAITKIND_NO_RESUMED.
	(handle_inferior_event): Handle TARGET_WAITKIND_NO_RESUMED.
	(normal_stop): Handle TARGET_WAITKIND_NO_RESUMED.
	* target.h (enum target_waitkind) <TARGET_WAITKIND_NO_RESUMED>: New.

	gdb/testsuite/
	* gdb.threads/no-unwaited-for-left.c: New.
	* gdb.threads/no-unwaited-for-left.exp: New.
	* gdb.threads/non-ldr-exc-1.c: New.
	* gdb.threads/non-ldr-exc-1.exp: New.
	* gdb.threads/non-ldr-exc-2.c: New.
	* gdb.threads/non-ldr-exc-2.exp: New.
	* gdb.threads/non-ldr-exc-3.c: New.
