@PR gdb/15911: "info threads" changes the default source and line (for "break", "list")

"info threads" changes the default source for "break" and "list", to
whatever the location of the first/bottom thread in the thread list
is...

 (gdb) c

The issue is that print_stack_frame always sets the current sal to the
frame's sal.  print_frame_info (which print_stack_frame calls to do
most of the work) also sets the last displayed sal, but only if
print_what isn't LOCATION.  Now the call in question, from within
thread.c:print_thread_info, does pass in LOCATION as print_what, but
print_stack_frame doesn't have the same check print_frame_info has.
We could consider adding it, but setting these globals depending on
print_what isn't very clean, IMO.  What we have is two logically
distinct operations mixed in the same function(s):

  #1 - print frame, in the format specified by {print_what,
    print_level and print_args}.

  #2 - We're displaying a frame to the user, and I want the default
    sal to point here, because the program stopped here, or the user
    did some context-changing command (up, down, etc.).

So I added a new parameter to print_stack_frame & friends for point
#2, and went through all calls in the tree adjusting as necessary.

Tested on x86_64 Fedora 17.
