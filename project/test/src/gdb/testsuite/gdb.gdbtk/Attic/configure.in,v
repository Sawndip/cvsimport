@        * README: New file.

        * configure.in: Check for executable filename extension.
        * Makefile.in: Add filename extensions.
        * configure: Regenerated.

        * defs: Fix typo setting _test(verbose).
        (gdbtk_test_file): New proc to load executables into gdbtk.
        (gdbtk_test_run): New proc to run executables on gdbtk.
        * browser.exp: Don't check if DISPLAY is set: let
        gdbtk_initialize_display do it all for us.
        Call gdbtk_done when finished with tests.
        * c_variable.exp: Ditto.
        * console.exp: Ditto.
        * cpp_variable.exp: Ditto.
        Only run tests if c++ is supported in the configuration.
        * srcwin.exp: Ditto the DISPLAY stuff.
        Accumulate all test results for the end and report them then.

        * browser.test: Use gdbtk_test_file and gdbtk_test_run
        to load and run an executable.
        * c_variable.test: Use gdbtk_test_file and gdbtk_test_run
        to load and run an executable.
        * srcwin.test: Ditto.
        * srcwin1.test: Ditto.
        * srcwin2.test: Ditto.
        * browser.test: (set_search_mode): Use "configure
        -value" not "entryset" to set the combobox's value. We need
        to have the command fired.
        (browser-3.5): Remove trailing whitespace which causes test to
        fail.
        (browser-4.4): Expect something rational. Regexp "\_1$" cannot
        match "func_10"!
        (browser-4.5): Ditto.
        (browser-5.12): Select all files for search to make test
        match description.
        (browser-6.2): Renamed from another test also calledd 6.1.
        (browser-7.1): Delete all breakpoints at once without from_tty.
        Select all entries in the comobox before invoking BP set/delete
        button.
        (browser-7.2): Ditto.

        * list0.c, list1.c, list0.h: New files. Grabbed from gdb.base.
        * srcwin.exp: Use these local files instead of those in gdb.base.
