1.1
log
@Fix the x87 FP register printout when issuing the “info float” command.

Consider the following simple program:

.globl  _start
.text
_start:
      fldt    val
.data
      val: .byte 0x00,0x00,0x45,0x07,0x11,0x19,0x22,0xe9,0xfe,0xbf

With current GDB on x86-64 GNU/Linux hosts, after the moment the fldt
command has been executed the register st(0) looks like this,
according to the “info regs” output (TOP=7):

  R7: Valid   0xffffffbffffffffeffffffe922191107450000 -0.910676542908976927

which is clearly wrong (just count its length).  The problem is due to
the printf statement (see patch) printing a promoted integer value of
a char argument "raw[i]", and, since char is signed on x86-64
GNU/Linux, the erroneous “ffffff” are printed for the first three
bytes which turn out to be "negative".  The fix is to use gdb_byte
instead which is unsigned (and is the type of value_contents(), the
type to be used for raw target bytes anyway).  After the fix the value
will be printed correctly:

  R7: Valid   0xbffee922191107450000 -0.910676542908976927
