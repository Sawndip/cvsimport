<BODY>
<H1>Tracepoint Dialogs</H1>
<H3>Overview</H3>
<P>There are two Tracepoint Dialogs which help users set tracepoints:
The Tracepoint Dialog is used to view and add actions and The Actions
Dialog is used to edit a particular action specified in the
tracepoint's Action List.</P>

<P>Tracepoint Dialogs topics:
<UL>
    <LI><A HREF="#tracedlg">The Tracepoint Dialog</A>
        <UL>
            <LI><A HREF="#t_experiment">Experiment Frame</A>

         </UL>
</UL></P>

<H3><A NAME="tracedlg">The Tracepoint Dialog</H3>
The Tracepoint Dialog is the gateway to viewing and editing
the properties of any tracepoint. The same dialog is used
to add new tracepoints and edit and delete existing tracepoints,
for both single tracepoints and ranges of tracepoints.

<H4><A NAME="t_experiment">Experiment Frame</A></H4>
The Experiment Frame displays information about the tracepoint's
location in the program and its status. Specifically,
<DL>
    <DT>Number
        <DD>The internal number for this tracepoint. New tracepoints
            all have the number "-1". This number may be used to
            refer to specific tracepoints when using the
            <A HREF="console.html">Console Window</A>
    <DT>Hit Count
        <DD>The number of times the tracepoint has been hit
    <DT>Thread
        <DD>The thread in which the tracepoint exists. This
            feature is not currently implemented.
    <DT>Function
        <DD>The function in which the tracepoint is set
    <DT>File
        <DD>The file in which the tracepoint is set
    <DT>Line(s)
        <DD>The line at which the tracepoint is set or the
            lines which the tracepoint range affects
</DL>
<BR>

<H4><A NAME="t_actions">Actions Frame</A></H4>
The Actions Frame displays the user-settable properties of the
tracepoint, including all actions and a pass count.

<P>A pass count specifies the number of times that the tracepoint
can be hit on the target before the tracing experiment ceases. A
pass count of five means that this tracepoint will issue a silent
"tstop" when it is hit the fifth time (after it has performed all
it actions). A pass count of zero (0) means that the tracepoint
will never causes the trace experiment to terminate on the target.</P>

<P>To <A NAME="t_actions_add">add an action</A> for the tracepoint,
select the appropriate action from the Action ComboBox and click
"Add". The <A HREF="#actionsdlg">Action Dialog</A> appears to
allow editing the action's properties.</P>

<P>Currently, there are two actions: collect and while-stepping.
Any number of collect actions may be added to specify that the
target should collect variables, registers, and memory when
it is hit. The while-stepping action may be used to collect
data for a specified number of machine instructions. Only one
while-stepping action may be specified for any tracepoint.</P>

<P>To <A NAME="t_actions_modify">modify the actions</A> associated
with a tracepoint, double-click the left mouse button on the action
listed in the Action Frame, and the <A HREF="#actionsdlg">Actions
Dialog</A> will appear.</P>

<P>To accept the tracepoint as displayed, click the OK button. To abort
installing or editing the tracepoint, click the CANCEL button. To delete
the tracepoint (if it is not a new tracepoint), click the DELETE button.</P>

<H3><A NAME="actionsdlg">The Actions Dialog</A></H3>
The Actions Dialog is used to edit an action for the tracepoint. It
consists of two lists, one containing all (uncollected) local variables
(including function arguments) and registers, and one containing everything
being collected.

<P>The <A NAME="#a_variables">Variables List</A> lists all uncollected local variables,
function arguments, and registers  and may also display the special indentifiers
"All Locals", "All Arguments", and "All Registers". Global variables (and file static
variables) do not appear on the Variable List.</P>

<P>To move a variable from the Variables List to the Collection List, double-click
the variable in the Variables List or select the variable in the Variable
List and press the "<<< Collect" button. To specify a range of variables to be
collected, select them in the Variables list and click the "<<< Collect" button.</P>

<P><A NAME="a_collect">The Collection List displays all data being collected
by the action, including the special types "All Locals", "All Registers", and
"All Arguments", which specify that every local variable, every register, and
every function argument will be collected, respectively. Specifying a local
variable, for example, and "All Locals" will cause only the special identifier
"All Locals" to be sent to the target. Analogously, "All Registers" and "All
Arguments" also override any register or function argument specifically listed
in the Collection List.</P>

<P>To remove data from the Collection List, double-click any of the entries listed
in the List, or select a range of data to be removed and press the "Ignore >>>"
button. All local variables, function arguments, registers, and special identifiers
will be returned to the Variable List, while any expression (memory ranges, globals)
will simply "disappear". To add these again, use the <A HREF="#a_other">Other Entry</A>
at the bottom of the display.</P>

<P>The <A NAME="#a_other">Other Entry</A> can be used to move any variable listed in
either the Collection List or the Variable List to the other list. It can also
be used to specify expressions for collection, such as memory ranges and global variables.
Simply enter the name of the global variable or the expression and press the enter key on
the keyboard. If the expression is valid, it will be added/removed from the Collection
List.</P>
