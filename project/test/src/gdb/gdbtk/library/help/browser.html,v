<H1>The Function Browser</H1>
<img src="images/browser1.png" alt="layout1" width=164 height=171 align="right" border=0>
<img src="images/browser2.png" alt="layout2" width=164 height=170 align="right" border=0>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The Function Browser may be used to search for specific functions
in the executable, allowing the user to easily browse through source
code and set and clear breakpoints at anywhere in the executable
with ease. Its powerful regular expression searches allow the user
to easily set breakpoints on multiple functions at once.</p>
<p>The Function Browser has two different layouts. Both layouts contain the same four sections;
Files, Function Filter, Functions, and Source Display.</p>

<h3>Files</h3>
<p>The Files section displays a list of all the source files.  The files are
read from the debug information in the program being debugged. To see
the list of functions in a file, click on it.  The function list should appear
in the Functions Display and the source should appear in the Source Display.
You can select multiple files by using the Control or Shift keys while
clicking the left mouse button. When multiple files are selected, all the functions in those files
are displayed in the Functions Display.
</p>
<p>At the bottom of the Files Display, you should see a checkbutton labelled "Hide .h files"
and a button labelled "Select All". Checking "Hide .h files" will remove all
files ending in ".h" from the Files Display. Clicking "Select All" will select all files
in the Files Display.</p>

<h3>Function Filter</h3>
<p>Above the Function Display you should see a section labelled "Function Filter".
The purpose of this section is to apply a filter to the list of functions in the Functions Display.
For example, if you click "Select All" in the Files Display, then many hundreds of functions
could appear in the Functions Display.  To see all functions containing the string "print", for example, click on the combobox in the Function Filter and select "contains".
Then type "print" into the box to the right and hit the enter or return key. You should see the Function
Display updated with a list of all functions containing "print".</p>

<p>Insight remember what the last filter you used was and will always open the Function
Browser window with the last filter settings.
</p>

<h3>Function Display</h3>
<p>The Function Display contains the list of functions in the files that have been
selected in the Files Display, after running them through any filter settings in the Filter Display.
There are two buttons at the bottom of the display that allow you so set or delete breakpoints on every function
in the Function Display in one operation.
</p>
<p>For example, to set a breakpoint of every function name containing "print", follow the example in the Function Filter section to
get a list of all functions containing "print". Then simply click the "Set BP" button.</p>

<h3>Source Display</h3>
<p>The Source Display shows the source code for any file selected in the File Display.  If a function
is selected in the Function Display, the first line of that function containing
executable code will be highlighted.  If no source file is found, then the function will be
displayed disassembled.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the window are two comboboxes and a text field.  The combobox on the far left
contains the function name or file location to display.  Normally this is just output for your information, however
you can type the name of any function into this box to see its source.
</p>
<p>To the right of this is another combobox that allows you to toggle between source and assembly.
</p>
<p>To the far right is an empty field.   You can type a string in it and hit enter to
search the current source file for any string.</p>
<p>In the source window itself, you can set breakpoints just like the source window.</p>
<h3>Popup Menu</h3>
<p>If you click the right mouse button while over the File Browser, you should get a simple menu
with three options; <i>Toggle Layout</i>, <i>Help</i>, and <i>Close</i>. <i>Toggle Layout</i>
switches you between the two different Browser Window layouts. Choose the one you like best;
Insight will remember it between sessions. <i>Help</i> pops up this help window. <i>Close</i> closes the Function Browser.

<H2><A NAME="display">Function Browser Display</A></H2>
The Function Browser display shows all the current search
parameters specified by the user: search type, search expression,
and files to search.

<H4><A NAME="display_search">Searching for a Function</A></H4>
To search for a function, enter
the name of the function into the "Search for" field at the top
of the Function Browser and press the Enter key on the keyboard
or press the Search button in the lower right-hand corner. The
Function Browser searches through every file contained in the
executable (including libraries and included files) for the
specified function. If the function is found in the executable's
symbol table, the Functions listing will contain the function's
name.

<H4><A NAME="display_limit">Limiting the Search</A></H4>
Searches are not confined to one specific function. The Function
Browser is capable of searching for any function which matches
the expression entered into the "Search for" field. For example,
to list all functions which start with the letters c, y, and g,
enter "cyg" into the search field and press enter. Every function
which begins with these three letters is displayed. To search
for all functions which do <I>not</I> begin with the letters "a",
"b", and "c", enter the regular expression "^[^a-c]" into the search
field, click the "Use regular expression" checkbox, and then click
Search (or press the Enter key on the keyboard). The Browser returns 
the names of all matching functions.

<P>Additionally, any search may be limited in two more ways:
the Browser may be configured to search only specified files and
list only static functions.</P>

<P>To search specific files only, select the files to be searched
using the Files list. To select all files for searching, click the
Select All button at the bottom of the Files listing. Note that
the Select All button changes to Select None, allowing the user to
deselect all selected files. With no files selected, the Browser
will search all files in the project.</P>

<P>To search for static functions only, click the "Only show
functions declared 'static'" before searching.</P>

<H4><A NAME="display_break">Toggling Breakpoints</A></H4>
There are numerous ways to toggle
breakpoints on functions using the Function Browser. To toggle the
breakpoint at all listed matches in the Functions list, press the
Toggle Breakpoint button. To toggle a breakpoint at some subset
of functions listed in the Functions list, click the right mouse
button on each function's name in the list. The last way to toggle
breakpoints using the function browser involves viewing the function's
source code.

<H4><A NAME="display_source">Viewing Source Code</A></H4>
To view the source code for a function,
select the function in the Functions list and click the "View Source"
dropdown (if it is not already dropped down). A Source Viewer
similar to the <A HREF="source.html#display">Source Window Display</A>
appears at the bottom. Toggle breakpoints as described in
<A HREF="source.html#setting_a_breakpoint">Setting a Breakpoint</A>
in <A HREF="source.html">Source Window Help</A>.
