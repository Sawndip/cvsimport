	* msrselection.ith: 
	* msrselection.itb: 
	* cpuinfo.tcl: Put (C) after Copyright.

2002-08-14  Keith Seitz  <keiths@@redhat.com>

	Merged from Red Hat internal branch:

	2001-11-30  Keith Seitz  <keith@@redhat.com>
	* Makefile.in: New file.
	* intel-pentium.tcl: Renamed to intel-pentium.tcl.in.
	* plugins.tcl: This plugin is only available on non-native targets.
	Append to ../plugins.tcl and remove.

	2001-11-28  Ian Roxborough  <irox@@redhat.com>
	* cpuinfo.tcl (display_cpu_info): exec the gdb command
	"info cpu" to get the extra cpuinformation (CPU ID).
	* library/plugins/intel-pentium/msrselection.itb
	(MsrSelDlg::build_win): Switch the OK and Cancel buttons
	around to improve ease of use.
	* plugins.tcl:	Use "$::GDBStartup" rather than "$GDBStartup".
	Create a sub menu in the plugins menu called "Intel Pentium"
	and place the menu items in it.

	2001-11-21  Ian Roxborough  <irox@@redhat.com>
	* msrselection.itb (MsrSelDlg::list_msrs): Use
	"set msr-pointer" instead of "set msr".
	(MsrSelDlg::doit): Set the msr-pointer before calling
	unpost.  Display an error message is we can't set the
	msr-pointer.

	2001-11-16  Ian Roxborough  <irox@@redhat.com>
	* cpuinfo.tcl: New file.
	* intel-pentium.tcl: Ditto.
	* cpuinfo.tcl: Ditto.
	* msrselection.itb: Ditto.
	* msrselection.ith: Ditto.
	* pkgIndex.tcl: Ditto.
	* plugins.tcl: Ditto.
	* tclIndex: Ditto.

@Add improved support for plugin handling. Much of the plugins have simply
been copied from ../library/plugins.
