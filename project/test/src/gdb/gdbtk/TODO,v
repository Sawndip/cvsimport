	* TODO: New file.  Initial version of the TODO file, as posted to the
	insight list circa October 2000.

@If you find inaccuracies in this list, please send mail to
insight@@sources.redhat.com.  If you would like to work on any
of these, you should consider sending mail to the same address, to
find out whether anyone else is working on it.

                New Features and Enhancements
                =============================

Display of the target program output.  Perhaps use the XTerm hack created
by Tom.

--

Support for inserting breakpoints at arbitrary locations, perhaps adding an
entry widget to the breakpoints window.

--

Support for hardware breakpoints and watchpoints (will need fixes in gdb).

--

"Disassembly from Memory" Window. Perhaps as a pane in place of the source
code one.

--

Register Window capable of handling large number of registers, typed
registers, registers organized in groups that can be shown/hidden and
that provide for better screen organization.

--

Per-project preferences so that one can have a preferred target settings
for each project (and environment variable and the current directory would
be searched for the project preference file -- global preferences would
still come from the users's home directory).

--

Reactivate the "Use this target?" confirmation box.  Do it independently of
the above?

--

Add option to activate the Source Window from the signal popup box when
the inferior program is signaled.

                     Code Cleanups
                     =============

Reorganize the Source Memory code.

--

Clean up the class hierarchy.

--

Migrate to Tcl/Tk 8.3.2

--

Try BLT tree as an alternative to the Tix Tree, so we can drop Tix altogether.

--

Optional use of installed Tcl/Tk (keeping it available on the distribution)

--

Fix the gdbtk testsuite.

--

Enhance the test harness, perhaps migrating to the new SourceNavigator testing
system.

                 Architectural Improvements
                 ==========================

Decouple the GUI from gdb, running them as separate processes.

--

Separate the Tcl part from the Tk part to facilitate scripting.

                        Bug Fixes
                        =========

Fix process attach, specially the process listing code.

Fix Source Window so that Key shortcuts work (may not be possible without
rewritting).

Fix info popup annoyances (like trying to show a large array without even
adding line breaks and showing up over right click menus).

Fix command window command line recall that misses the arguments of
commands that autoincrement their arguments.

Fix function browser window problems.

Maximization of a window affects preference sizing but forgets that maximized
state was set.

Taskbar "always on top" hides funcxtion combobox.
