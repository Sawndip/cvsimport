@remove msymbol_objfile

This is another patch in my ongoing series to "split" objfile to share
more read-only data across inferiors.  See

    http://sourceware.org/gdb/wiki/ObjfileSplitting

When symbols are finally shared, there will be no back-link from the
symbol to its containing objfile, because there may be more than one
such objfile.  So, all such back-links must be removed.

One hidden back-link is the msymbol_objfile function.  Since
(eventually) a symbol may appear in more than one objfile, trying to
look up the objfile given just a symbol cannot work.

This patch removes msymbol_objfile in favor of using a bound minimal
symbol.  It introduces a new function to make this conversion simpler
in some spots.

The bonus of this patch is that using msymbol_objfile is slower than
simply looking up the owning objfile in the first place.

Built and regtested on x86-64 Fedora 18.

   A minimal symbol is a symbol for which there is no direct debug

   created from the ELF symbol table.

   For the definition of the minimal symbol structure, see struct
   minimal_symbol in symtab.h.
