@[GDBserver] Multi-process + multi-arch

This patch makes GDBserver support multi-process + biarch.

Currently, if you're debugging more than one process at once with a
single gdbserver (in extended-remote mode), then all processes must
have the same architecture (e.g., 64-bit vs 32-bit).  Otherwise, you
see this:

... etc, etc ...

Even though the process was running a 32-bit program, GDBserver sent
back to GDB a register set in 64-bit layout.

A patch (http://sourceware.org/ml/gdb-patches/2012-11/msg00228.html) a
while ago made GDB track a target_gdbarch per inferior, and as
consequence, fetch a target description per-inferior.  This patch is
the GDBserver counterpart, that makes GDBserver keep track of each
process'es XML target description and register layout.  So in the
example above, GDBserver will send the correct register set in 32-bit
layout to GDB.

A new "struct target_desc" object (tdesc for short) is added, that
holds the target description and register layout information about
each process.  Each `struct process_info' holds a pointer to a target
description.  The regcache also gains a pointer to a target
description, mainly for convenience, and parallel with GDB (and
possible future support for programs that flip processor modes).

The low target's arch_setup routines are responsible for setting the
process'es correct tdesc.  This isn't that much different to how
things were done before, except that instead of detecting the inferior
process'es architecture and calling the corresponding
init_registers_FOO routine, which would change the regcache layout
globals and recreate the threads' regcaches, the regcache.c globals
are gone, and the init_registers_$BAR routines now each initialize a
separate global struct target_desc object (one for each arch variant
GDBserver supports), and so all the init_registers_$BAR routines that
are built into GDBserver are called early at GDBserver startup time
(similarly to how GDB handles its built-in target descriptions), and
then the arch_setup routine is responsible for making
process_info->tdesc point to one of these target description globals.
The regcache module is all parameterized to get the regcache's layout
from the tdesc object instead of the old register_bytes, etc. globals.

The threads' regcaches are now created lazily.  The old scheme where
we created each of them when we added a new thread doesn't work
anymore, because we add the main thread/lwp before we see it stop for
the first time, and it is only when we see the thread stop for the
first time that we have a chance of determining the inferior's
architecture (through the_low_target.arch_setup).  Therefore when we
add the main thread we don't know which architecture/tdesc its
regcache should have.

This patch makes the gdb.multi/multi-arch.exp test now pass against
(extended-remote) GDBserver.  It currently fails, without this patch.

The IPA also uses the regcache, so it gains a new global struct
target_desc pointer, which points at the description of the process it
is loaded in.

Re. the linux-low.c & friends changes.  Since the register map
etc. may differ between processes (64-bit vs 32-bit) etc., the
linux_target_ops num_regs, regmap and regset_bitmap data fields are no
longer sufficient.  A new method is added in their place that returns
a pointer to a new struct that includes all info linux-low.c needs to
access registers of the current inferior.

The patch/discussion that originally introduced
linux-low.c:disabled_regsets mentions that the disabled_regsets set
may be different per mode (in a biarch setup), and indeed that is
cleared whenever we start a new (first) inferior, so that global is
moved as well behind the new `struct regs_info'.

On the x86 side:

I simply replaced the i387-fp.c:num_xmm_registers global with a check
for 64-bit or 32-bit process, which is equivalent to how the global
was set.  This avoided coming up with some more general mechanism that
would work for all targets that use this module (GNU/Linux, Windows,
etc.).

@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.
