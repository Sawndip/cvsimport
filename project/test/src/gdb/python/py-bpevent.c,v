@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.

	Handle multiple breakpoint hits in Python interface:
	* python/py-bpevent.c (create_breakpoint_event_object): Rename C/Python
	variable to breakpoints.
	* python/py-stopevent.c (emit_stop_event): Return a Python tuple of
	bps instead of single breakpoint. Fix some space typos.

	variable to breakpoints.

testsuite:
	* gdb.python/py-events.exp: Set a duplicate breakpoint and check its
	presence.
	* gdb.python/py-events.py (breakpoint_stop_handler): Browse all the
	breakpoint hits.

doc:
	* gdb.texinfo (Events In Python): New function documentation:
	gdb.BreakpointEvent.breakpoints. Indicate that
	gdb.BreakpointEvent.breakpoint is now deprecated.
