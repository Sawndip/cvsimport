@Extract Linux-specific portitions of cris-tdep.c to a new file.
This brings in some standard functionality hitherdo missing from
the CRIS/CRISv32 port thanks to the new call to gdbarch_init_osabi,
as well as clearly showing that there is Linux support for this
platform by virtue of the existence of a cris-linux-tdep.c file.

2013-09-06  Ricard Wanderlof  <ricardw@@axis.com>

	* Makefile.in (ALL_TARGET_OBS): Add cris-linux-tdep.o.
	* configure.tgt: Add cris-linux-tdep.o and linux-tdep.o to
	gdb_target_obs for cris target.
	* cris-tdep.c (struct gdbarch_tdep): Move to cris-tdep.h.
	(cris_gdbarch_init): Move calls to
	set_gdbarch_fetch_tls_load_module_address and
	set_solib_svr4_fetch_link_map_offsets to cris-linux-tdep.c.
	Add call to gdbarch_init_osabi.
	* cris-linux-tdep.c: New file.
	* cris-tdep.h: New file.
