@Consistent use of (C) after "Copyright".

While writing the previous patch, I noticed that we're not consistent
with the (C) in the copyright header.  The maintainers manual prefers
having it, though also says it's optional.  We have over 10x more
files with (C) than without in gdb's code, so I spent a few minutes
grepping and fixing.  Funny enough, the testsuite has it backwards.
I'll leave that for another time.

@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.
