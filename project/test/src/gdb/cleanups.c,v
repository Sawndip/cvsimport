/* The cleanup list records things that have to be undone
   if an error happens (descriptors to be closed, memory to be freed, etc.)
   Each link in the chain records a function to call and an
   argument to give it.

   Use make_cleanup to add an element to the cleanup chain.
   Use do_cleanups to do all cleanup actions back to a given
   point in the chain.  Use discard_cleanups to remove cleanups
   from the chain back to a given point, not doing them.

   If the argument is pointer to allocated memory, then you need
   to additionally set the 'free_arg' member to a function that will
   free that memory.  This function will be called both when the cleanup
   is executed and when it's discarded.  */

@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.
