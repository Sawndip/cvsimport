@use gnulib's update-copyright script to update copyright years

This patch now retires the old copyright.sh script which was using
emacs to perform the copyright update. It also completely rewrite
copyright.py to call update-copyright with the appropriate list
of files.

In addition to calling update-copyright, the new script also performs
a sanity-check on all the files that update-copyright could not update,
and sees whether the file might contain a copyright notice that
the script could not decipher.

gdb/ChangeLog:

        * copyright.sh: Delete.
        * copyright.py: Rewrite.

# Usage: cd src/gdb && sh ./copyright.sh
# To use a different version of emacs, set the EMACS environment
# variable before running.

# After running, update those files mentioned in $byhand by hand.
# Always review the output of this script before committing it!
# A useful command to review the output is:
#  filterdiff -x \*.c -x \*.cc -x \*.h -x \*.exp updates.diff
# This removes the bulk of the changes which are most likely
# to be correct.

####
# Configuration
####

# As of Emacs 22.0 (snapshot), wrapping and copyright updating do not
# handle these file types - all reasonable:
#  Assembly (weird comment characters, e.g. "!"); .S usually has C
#            comments, which are fine)
#  Fortran ("c" comment character)
#  igen
#  Autoconf input (dnl)
#  texinfo (@@c)
#  tex (%)
#  *.defs as C
#   man
# So these need to be done either by hand, as needed, or by the copyright.py
# script.
