/* The libdecnumber library, on which GDB depends, includes a header file
   called gstdint.h instead of relying directly on stdint.h.  GDB, on the
   other hand, includes stdint.h directly, relying on the fact that gnulib
   generates a copy if the system doesn't provide one or if it is missing
   some features.  Unfortunately, gstdint.h and stdint.h cannot be included
   at the same time, which may happen when we include a file from
   libdecnumber.

   The purpose of this file is to override the libdecnumber/gstdint.h file
   to use stdint.h instead.  Thanks to the order of our include path,
   files from the GDB source tree have precedence over files from our
   dependencies.  So the presence of this file will ensure that we
   consistently use the same stdint.h file when compiling GDB source
   files.  */
