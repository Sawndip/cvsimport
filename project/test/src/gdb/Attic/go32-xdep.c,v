@Sync up with Cygnus CVS repository (cvs import doesn't handle these
automatically, alas.  This cleanpu must be automated in the near future).
Tue Mar  9 19:25:11 1999  Stan Shebs  <shebs@@andros.cygnus.com>
        * h8-cfg.texi: Remove, hasn't been used in years.
1999-05-10  Martin Hunt  <hunt@@cygnus.com>
        * debugify.c, debugify.h: Removed because they are no
        longer used.
Tue Mar 16 15:29:04 1999  Stan Shebs  <shebs@@andros.cygnus.com>
        * go32-xdep.c: Remove, no longer used by anything.
