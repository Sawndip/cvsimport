@Update years in copyright notice for the GDB files.

Two modifications:
  1. The addition of 2013 to the copyright year range for every file;
  2. The use of a single year range, instead of potentially multiple
     year ranges, as approved by the FSF.

/* An aggregate.   A single immediate operand, N>0, gives
   the number of component specifications that follow.  The
   immediate operand is followed by a second OP_AGGREGATE.  
   Next come N component specifications.  A component
   specification is either an OP_OTHERS (others=>...), an
   OP_CHOICES (for named associations), or other expression (for
   positional aggregates only).  Aggregates currently
   occur only as the right sides of assignments. */
OP (OP_AGGREGATE)

/* An others clause.  Followed by a single expression. */
OP (OP_OTHERS)

/* An aggregate component association.  A single immediate operand, N, 
   gives the number of choices that follow.  This is followed by a second
   OP_CHOICES operator.  Next come N operands, each of which is an
   expression, an OP_DISCRETE_RANGE, or an OP_NAME---the latter 
   for a simple name that must be a record component name and does 
   not correspond to a single existing symbol.  After the N choice 
   indicators comes an expression giving the value.

   In an aggregate such as (X => E1, ...), where X is a simple
   name, X could syntactically be either a component_selector_name 
   or an expression used as a discrete_choice, depending on the
   aggregate's type context.  Since this is not known at parsing
   time, we don't attempt to disambiguate X if it has multiple
   definitions, but instead supply an OP_NAME.  If X has a single
   definition, we represent it with an OP_VAR_VALUE, even though
   it may turn out to be within a record aggregate.  Aggregate 
   evaluation can use either OP_NAMEs or OP_VAR_VALUEs to get a
   record field name, and can evaluate OP_VAR_VALUE normally to
   get its value as an expression.  Unfortunately, we lose out in
   cases where X has multiple meanings and is part of an array
   aggregate.  I hope these are not common enough to annoy users,
   who can work around the problem in any case by putting
   parentheses around X. */
OP (OP_CHOICES)

/* A positional aggregate component association.  The operator is 
   followed by a single integer indicating the position in the 
   aggregate (0-based), followed by a second OP_POSITIONAL.  Next 
   follows a single expression giving the component value.  */
OP (OP_POSITIONAL)

/* A range of values.  Followed by two expressions giving the
   upper and lower bounds of the range. */
