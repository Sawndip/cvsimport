@@node Introduction
@@chapter Introduction

This document details the implementation and internals of CGEN, the
``Cpu tools GENerator''.  It focuses on theory of operation and concepts
rather than extensive details of the implementation -- these details
date too quickly.

@@node Conventions
@@chapter Conventions

There are a number of conventions used in the CGEN source code.  If you
take the time to absorb these now, the code will be much easier to
understand.

@@itemize @@bullet

@@item Procedures and variables local to a file are named @@code{-foo}.

@@item Only routines that emit application code begin with @@code{gen-}.

@@item Symbols beginning with @@code{c-} are either variables containing C code
or procedures that generate C code, similarly for C++ and @@code{c++-}.

@@item Variables containing C code begin with @@code{c-}.

@@item Only routines that emit an entire file begin with @@code{cgen-}.

@@item All @@file{.cpu} file elements shall have @@code{-foo-parse} and
@@code{-foo-read} procedures.  These procedures all follow the same
basic style for processing entries.

@@item Global variables containing class definitions shall be named
@@code{<class-name>}.

@@item Procedures related to a particular class shall be named
@@code{class-name-proc-name}, where @@code{class-name} may be abbreviated.

@@item Procedures that test whether something is an object of a
particular class shall be named @@code{class-name?}.

@@item In keeping with Scheme conventions, predicates shall have a
@@code{?} suffix.

@@item In keeping with Scheme conventions, methods and procedures that
modify an argument or have other side effects shall have a
@@code{!} suffix, usually these procs return @@code{*UNSPECIFIED*}.

@@item All @@code{-foo-parse}, @@code{parse-foo} procs shall have @@code{context}
as the first argument. [FIXME: not all such procs have been converted]

@@end itemize

@@node Applications
@@chapter Applications

Applications of CGEN generate source code for various cpu related tools.
@@footnote{One of the neglected concepts in CGEN is that it is not just
an assembler/disassembler or simulator generator.  Those have just been
the ones immediately needed and are straightforward to do.}

When you want to run the CGEN framework, an application-specific source
file is loaded into the Guile interpreter to get CGEN running.  The main
job of this source file is to load in any other source files it needs and
then, ultimately, call the @@code{cgen} procedure.

Here's an example of the invocation of @@code{cgen} from @@file{cgen-sim.scm}.

@@example
    (cgen #:argv argv
	  #:app-name "sim"
	  #:arg-spec sim-arguments
	  #:init sim-init!
	  #:finish sim-finish!
	  #:analyze sim-analyze!))
@@end example

This gets the whole framework started by:

@@enumerate
@@item processing argv
@@item loading the @@file{.cpu} file(s)
@@item analyzing the instruction set
@@item generating the source code for the app
@@end enumerate

@@node Source file overview
@@chapter Source file overview

This table is a list of noteworthy files in CGEN.

@@table @@file

@@item *.cpu, *.opc, *.sim
Files belonging to each CPU description.
@@file{.opc} and @@file{.sim} files are automatically
included if they are defined for the given architecture.

@@item doc/*.texi
Texinfo documentation for CGEN.

@@item slib/*.scm
Third-party libraries written in Scheme.  For example, sort.scm is a
collection of procedures to sort lists.

@@item cgen-gas.scm
Top-level for GAS testsuite generation.

@@item cgen-opc.scm
Top-level for opcodes generation.

@@item cgen-sid.scm
Top-level for SID simulator generation.
 
@@item cgen-sim.scm
Top-level for older simulator generation.

@@item cgen-stest.scm
Top-level for simulator testsuite generation.

@@item cos.scm
CGEN object system.  Adds object oriented features to the Scheme
language.  See the top of @@file{cos.scm} for the user-visible
procedures.  Note that this was written before goops.
Switching to goops is not out of the question, it's just a question
of prioritization.

@@item read.scm
Read and parse @@file{.cpu} files.  @@code{maybe-load} is used to load in files
for required symbols if they are not already present in the environment
(say, because it was compiled).

This file contains @@code{cgen}, is the main entry point called by
application file generators.
It just calls @@code{-cgen}, but it does so wrapped inside a
@@code{catch-with-backtrace} procedure to make debugging easier.

@@item simplify.inc
Preprocessor macros to simplify CPU description files.  This file is not
loaded by the Scheme interpreter, but is instead included by each
@@file{.cpu} file.

@@end table

@@node Version numbering
@@chapter Version numbering

There are two version numbers: the version number of CGEN itself and a
version number for the description language it accepts.  These are kept
in the symbols @@code{-CGEN-VERSION} and @@code{-CGEN-LANG-VERSION} in
@@file{read.scm}.

@@node Parsing
@@chapter Parsing

Parsing of @@file{.cpu} files is very consistent.
Each element of the cpu description is handled in the same way.

There are two forms for each cpu description element:

@@enumerate
@@item key/value pairs
@@item fixed order arguments
@@end enumerate

The key/value parser is named @@code{-<object>-read}.
For example, see @@code{-arch-read} in @@file{mach.scm}.
It sets up default values for all elements of the object, parses the parameters
that have been provided, and then calls the fixed-order parser.

The fixed order parser is named @@code{-<object>-parse}.
For example, see @@code{-arch-parse} in @@file{mach.scm}.
It validates the parameters and then builds the requested object.

@@node Debugging applications
@@chapter Debugging applications

The best way to debug your application @@emph{at this point} is to
use the @@code{logit} function to get a log of what cgen is doing.
Or if you need a backtrace at a certain point then insert @@code{error}
function calls at select places to cause the interpreter to output a
stack backtrace.  This can be useful for answering the
``How did I get here?'' question.

Guile 1.8 provides better debugging facilities than previous versions.
These need to be investigated and documented here.

@@node Debugging pmacros
@@chapter Debugging pmacros

At the implementation level, pmacros are expanded with the
@@code{pmacro-expand} Scheme procedure.
For interactive debugging purposes there is @@code{pmacro-dump}
which is easier to use.

When debugging pmacros it is useful to see how they are expanded.
When expanding them from the a Guile shell, remember that expressions
needed to be quoted lest Scheme try to evaluate them.

@@smallexample
guile> (define-pmacro '(foo a b) '(+ a b))
guile> (pmacro-dump '(foo 3 4))
(+ 3 4)
@@end smallexample

One can also use @@code{pmacro-debug} to expand a macro and trace its
expansion.

At the implementation level, pmacros are expanded with the
@@code{pmacro-expand} Scheme procedure.

When debugging pmacros it is useful to see how they are expanded.
When expanding them from the a Guile shell, remember that expressions
needed to be quoted lest Scheme try to evaluate them.

@@smallexample
guile> (define-pmacro '(foo a b) '(+ a b))

One can also use @@code{pmacro-trace} to expand a macro and trace its
expansion.
