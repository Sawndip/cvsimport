# Building a DSO with (unrecommended) non-pic pc-relative references
# to a versioned symbol in a library got caught by an assert in
# elf_cris_copy_indirect_symbol wherein the list of pc-relative
# references wasn't merged, but simply asserted to be NULL before
# copied to, on the merged-to (direct) symbol.  For versioned symbols,
# there was an "extra" copy made, to make a base-version symbol, where
# the copied-from pc-relative list was NULL but the copied-to symbol
# already had a list merged.

# The list was used to emit warning messages, but incorrectly held the
# relocation section for the reference, resulting in warnings being
# emitted for any section with a pc-relative relocation.

# The test checks that there's a warning message only for the
# read-only sections section (.text) (not the read-write sections),
# that the correct number of relocations is emitted and we also check
# for the TEXTREL dynamic marker.
