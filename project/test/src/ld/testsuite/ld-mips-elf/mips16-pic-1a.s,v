log
@bfd/
	* reloc.c (BFD_RELOC_MIPS16_GOT16, BFD_RELOC_MIPS16_CALL16): Declare.
	* libbfd.h, bfd-in2.h: Regenerate.
	* elf32-mips.c (elf_mips16_howto_table_rel): Fill in reserved
	R_MIPS16_GOT16 and R_MIPS16_CALL16 entries.
	(mips16_reloc_map): Add mappings.
	* elf64-mips.c (mips16_elf64_howto_table_rel): Fill in reserved
	R_MIPS16_GOT16 and R_MIPS16_CALL16 entries.
	(mips16_elf64_howto_table_rela): Likewise.
	(mips16_reloc_map): Add mappings.
	* elfn32-mips.c (elf_mips16_howto_table_rel): Fill in reserved
	R_MIPS16_GOT16 and R_MIPS16_CALL16 entries.

	* elfxx-mips.c (mips_elf_create_shadow_symbol): New function.
	(section_allows_mips16_refs_p): Likewise.
	(mips16_stub_symndx): Likewise.
	(mips_elf_check_mips16_stubs): Treat the data argument as a
	bfd_link_info.  Mark every dynamic symbol as needing MIPS16 stubs
	and create a "shadow" symbol for the original MIPS16 definition.
	(mips16_reloc_p, got16_reloc_p, call16_reloc_p, hi16_reloc_p)
	(lo16_reloc_p, mips16_call_reloc_p): New functions.
	(_bfd_mips16_elf_reloc_unshuffle): Use mips16_reloc_p to generalize
	relocation checks.
	(_bfd_mips16_elf_reloc_shuffle): Likewise.
	(_bfd_mips_elf_lo16_reloc): Handle R_MIPS16_GOT16.
	(mips_elf_got16_entry): Add comment.
	(mips_elf_calculate_relocation): Use hi16_reloc_p,
	lo16_reloc_p, mips16_call_reloc_p, call16_reloc_p and got16_reloc_p
	to generalize relocation checks.  Use section_allows_mips16_refs_p
	instead of mips16_stub_section_p.   Handle R_MIPS16_CALL16 and
	R_MIPS16_GOT16, allowing the former to refer directly to a
	MIPS16 function if its stub is not needed.
	(mips16_stub_section_p): Delete.
	(_bfd_mips_elf_symbol_processing): Convert odd-valued function
	symbols into even MIPS16 symbols.
	(mips_elf_add_lo16_rel_addend): Use mips16_reloc_p to generalize
	a relocation check.
	(_bfd_mips_elf_check_relocs): Calculate "bed" and "rel_end"
	earlier in the function.  Use mips16_stub_symndx to identify
	the target function.  Avoid out-of-bounds accesses when the
	stub has no relocations; report an error instead.  Use
	section_allows_mips16_refs_p instead of mips16_stub_section_p.
	Use mips16_call_reloc_p and got16_reloc_p to generalize relocation
	checks.  Handle R_MIPS16_CALL16 and R_MIPS16_GOT16.  Don't create
	dynamic relocations for absolute references to __gnu_local_gp.
	(_bfd_mips_elf_always_size_sections): Pass a bfd_link_info as
	the argument to mips_elf_check_mips16_stubs.  Generalize comment.
	(_bfd_mips_elf_relocate_section): Use hi16_reloc_p and got16_reloc_p
	to generalize relocation checks.
	(_bfd_mips_elf_finish_dynamic_symbol): If a dynamic MIPS16 function
	symbol has a non-MIPS16 stub, redirect the symbol to the stub.
	Fix an overly long line.  Don't give dynamic symbols type STO_MIPS16.
	(_bfd_mips_elf_gc_sweep_hook): Handle R_MIPS16_CALL16 and
	R_MIPS16_GOT16.

gas/
	* config/tc-mips.c (mips16_reloc_p, got16_reloc_p, hi16_reloc_p)
	(lo16_reloc_p): New functions.
	(reloc_needs_lo_p): Use hi16_reloc_p and got16_reloc_p to
	generalize relocation checks.
	(matching_lo_reloc): New function.
	(fixup_has_matching_lo_p): Use it.
	(mips16_mark_labels): Don't clobber a symbol's visibility.
	(append_insn): Use hi16_reloc_p and lo16_reloc_p.

	(mips16_percent_op): Add %got and %call16.
	(mips_frob_file): Use got16_reloc_p to generalize relocation checks.
	Use matching_lo_reloc.
	(mips_force_relocation): Use hi16_reloc_p and lo16_reloc_p to
	generalize relocation checks.
	(mips_fix_adjustable): Use lo16_reloc_p to generalize relocation
	checks.
