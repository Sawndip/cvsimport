@Add x86 size relocation support to gas

gas/

	* config/tc-i386.c (reloc): Support BFD_RELOC_SIZE32.
	(tc_i386_fix_adjustable): Keep symbol for BFD_RELOC_32_SIZE and
	BFD_RELOC_64_SIZE relocations.
	(lex_got): Support "symbol@@SIZE" and don't create GOT symbol
	for it.
	(tc_gen_reloc): Resolve BFD_RELOC_SIZE32 and BFD_RELOC_SIZE64
	relocations against local symbols.

gas/testsuite/

	* gas/i386/i386.exp: Run size-1, size-2, size-3, size-4,
	x86-64-size-1, x86-64-size-2, x86-64-size-3, x86-64-size-4,
	x86-64-size-5 and x86-64-size-inval-1.
